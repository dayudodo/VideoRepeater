But hanging out would have to wait.

柔韧性训练就要几年时间

887
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,780
And years longer to apply it in combat!
还要更多年才能用于实战

889
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,720
Put that down!
把那放下！

891
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,290
The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones.
我们这儿收集的纪念品只有伤筋断骨

893
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:55,300
Yeah! Excellent.
哦也！太帅了！

895
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,300
Let's get started.
咱们开始吧

897
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,470
- Are you ready? - I was born re...

899
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,440
I'm sorry, brother. I thought you said you were ready.
抱歉，老兄，我还以为你说准备好了

901
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,810
That was awesome! Let's go again!
这可太过瘾了！咱们再来一次！

903
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,110
I've been taking it easy on you, panda. But no more.
我对你手下留情的，熊猫，可现在不会了

905
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,510
Your next opponent will be me.
你现在的对手轮到我了

907
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,350
All right! Yeah, let's go!
好啊！咱们来吧

909
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,910
Step forth.
往前一步

911
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,450
The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness...
想要真正获胜，就要攻击你对手的弱点

913
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,390
...and make him suffer for it.
让他因此痛不欲生

915
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,790
Oh, yeah!
噢，爽！

917
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,230
To take his strength and use it against him...
要借力打力

919
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,790
...until he finally falls...
直到他被击倒⋯

921
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,890
...or quits.
或放弃

923
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,930
A real warrior never quits.
一个真正的勇士绝不放弃

925
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:07,200
Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!
放心吧，师傅，我绝不放弃

927
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,780
If he's smart, he won't come back up those steps.
他要是聪明，就不会爬上来了

929
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,190
But he will.
他会上来的

931
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,560
He's not going to quit, is he?
他不会放弃的，是吗？

933
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,390
He's not going to quit bouncing, I'll tell you that.
我告诉你，他不会放弃翻滚的

935
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,330
I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better.
不是说针灸能让我好受些吗

937
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,440
Trust me, it will.
听我的没错

939
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,140
It's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this...
就是不太容易找准穴位，有这么多⋯

941
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,880
- Fat? - Fur. I was going to say fur.
- 肥肉？ - 毛皮，我想要说的是毛皮

943
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,940
Sure you were.
才怪

945
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,080
Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? Look at me.
咱们不能以大小论英雄，你看我

947
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,250
I'm over here.
我在这儿呢

949
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,790
Maybe you should look at this again.
你还是再看看这个吧

951
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,300
Oh, OK.
噢，对啊

953
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,090
Stop it. Stop!
停手，停下

955
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,210
I know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all...
我明白师傅这是在点拨我

957
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,200
...but if I didn't know better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.
可要是不了解他，我会以为他想赶我走

959
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,550
I know he can seem kind of heartless...
我知道他看起来铁石心肠

961
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,150
...but he wasn't always like that.
可他以前不是这样

963
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,550
According to legend,
据传说

965
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:32,150
there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile.
曾经的师傅总是面带微笑

967
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,160
- No! - Yes.

969
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,490
But that was before.
不过是在那事儿以前

971
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,560
Before what?
什么以前？

973
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,960
Before Tai Lung.
是大龙的事儿

975
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,630
We're not really supposed to talk about him.
我们其实不该去谈论他

977
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,700
Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know.
如果熊猫要留在这儿，他应该知道

979
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,710
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.
伙计们，我知道大龙

981
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:52,240
He was a student. The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.
他是个弟子，第一个掌握了千卷功夫秘籍

983
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:56,480
And then he turned bad, and now he's in jail.
后来他心眼坏了，现在关在大牢里

985
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,680
He wasn'tjust a student.
他不只是个弟子

987
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,860
Shifu found him as a cub...
他刚生下来，就被师傅捡到了

989
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,430
...and he raised him as his son.
师傅把他当儿子养大

991
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,860
And when the boy showed talent in kung fu...

993
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,240
...Shifu trained him.

995
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:23,440
He believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness.

997
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,880
It was never enough for Tai Lung.
而大龙心比天高

999
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,210
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.
他想要神龙秘籍

1001
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,590
But Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused.

1003
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,620
Outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley.
暴怒之下，大龙重创和平谷

1005
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,120
He tried to take the scroll by force.

1007
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,800
And Shifu had to destroy what he had created.

1009
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,330
But how could he?
可又怎么忍心

1011
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:10,840
Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before.
师傅从没像爱大龙那样爱过任何人

1013
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,160
Or since.
以后也一样

1015
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,510
And now he has a chance to make things right.

To train the true Dragon Warrior.
来训练出真正的神龙大侠

1019
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,910
And he's stuck with you.
碰着你这个活宝

1021
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,850
A big fat panda who treats it like a joke.

1023
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,750
That is it!

00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,950
Wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,360
Inner peace.
静下心来

00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,550
Inner peace.
静下心来

1037
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:15,050
Would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down?!
在那儿扇巴掌的人给我安静！

1039
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,560
Inner...
静下⋯

1041

Oh, Zeng.
噢，是小善啊

1043

I could use some good news right now.
正好能听些好消息

1047
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,040

I have... It's... It's very bad news.

There is just news. There is no good or bad.

Master, your vision. Your vision was right.

Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way.

00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,300
That is bad news...

00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,700
...if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.
要是你不相信神龙大侠能够阻止的话

1063
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:10,040
The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.
那个熊猫？大师，他才不是神龙大侠

1065
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,410
He wasn't meant to be here! It was an accident.

the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours,

Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

1085
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,200
I cannot make it blossom when it suits me,
我不能随心所欲催它开花

1087
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,540
nor make it bear fruit before its time.

00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,140
But there are things we can control.

...where to plant the seed.
在哪种下种子

1097
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,750
That is no illusion, Master.
这可不是幻想，大师

1099
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,390
Yes.
是啊

1101

that seed will grow to be a peach tree.
这颗种子都会长成桃树

1107
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,510
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

1109
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,240
Maybe it can.

...in my mind.

on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf and the energy of the universe.
仅凭银杏叶上的露珠和天地之气

Why didn't he?

Listen to me, all of you.

1
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,670
每次日出都意味着新的一天 新的开始
With every sun comes a new day. A new beginning.

2
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,586
希望今天会比昨天更好
A hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday.

3
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,136
但对于我来说不是 我叫伊普
But not for me. My name is Eep.

4
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,433
这是我的家人 我们是克鲁一家
And this is my family, the Croods.

5
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,979
如果你还没从我们的兽皮外衣和倾奇的前额
If you weren't clued in already by the animal skins

6
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:14,453
发现我们是谁的话 告诉你 我们是洞穴人
and sloping foreheads, we're cavemen.

7
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,810
我们大多宅在洞穴里 宅在黑暗里
Most days we spend in our cave, in the dark.

8
00:01:20,473 --> 00:01:24,746
日复一日 夜复一夜地宅着
Night after night, day after day.

9
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,863
对 温馨的家哪
Yep, home sweet home.

10
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,107
一旦有机会出去 我们就想方设法
When we did go out, we struggled to find food

11
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:33,720
在充满危险的世界中寻找食物
in a harsh and hostile world.

12
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,493
我则绞尽脑汁独自逃生
And I struggled to survive my family.

13
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,132
我们是最后的洞穴人了 曾经有其他的洞穴人
We were the last ones around. There used to be neighbors.

14
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,947
高姿一家 被猛犸象一脚踩成肉泥
The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.

15
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:48,570
霍克一家 被沙蛇一口吞进肚里
The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.

16
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,208
尔福一家 被蚊子活活咬死
The Erfs, mosquito bite.

17
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:54,864
斯洛格一家 得个感冒就能死
Throgs, common cold.

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,036
克鲁一家…就是我们啦
And the Croods, that's us.

19
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,428
我们活下来全靠我那爹
The Croods made it, because of my dad.

20
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,023
他死壮死壮的 特别循规蹈矩
He was strong, and he followed the rules.

21
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,789
就是我们洞穴墙上的规矩
The ones painted on the cave walls.

22
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:10,395
任何新事物都是不好的 好奇是不好的
Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad.

23
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:11,839
晚上外出是不好的
Going out at night is bad.

24
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:13,968
基本上任何有意思的事都是不好的
Basically, anything fun is bad.

25
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,614
欢迎来到我的苦逼世界
Welcome to my world.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,460
但这故事要说的是
But this is a story about

27
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,806
那一切怎样在瞬间全改变了
how all that changed in an instant.

28
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,022
因为我们不知道我们的世界
Because what we didn't know was that our world...

29
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:28,308
马上就要玩完了
was about to come to an end.

30
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,018
墙上可没有规矩教我们如何应付这种情况
And there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that.

31
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,621
你应该等我信号再出来的 小伊
You are supposed to wait for my signal. Eep?

32
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,647
嘿
Boo.

33
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,295
不要！
Ow! No!

34
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,229
我们都在那破山洞里呆一万年了
We've been in that cave forever.

35
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:14,695
三天可不是一万年
Three days is not forever.

36
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,517
对于这个家就是
It is with this family.

37
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:21,039
小伊 给我下来呗？你太…招摇过市了
Eep, would you come down here? You're being so dramatic.

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,675
不 小沙 回来！
No, Sandy, come back here.

39
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,406
记住等信号 好姑娘都会等信号的 阿加！
Remember the signal. Good girls wait for the signal. Ugga.

40
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,861
抓住小沙我就回去 你就可以发信号了
As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in, and you can give the signal.

41
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,650
不 但你们早出来了
No, I mean, you're already out now.

42
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,216
我在等你信号的 爸爸！
I'm waiting for the signal, Dad.

43
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,514
没事了 桑克 出来吧
Never mind, Thunk. Just come out.

44
00:03:37,514 --> 00:03:41,537
但你要是不给我信号 我咋知道你是我爹？
But if you don't give the signal, how do I know you're my dad?

45
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,152
信号不是让你知道是我
The signal isn't so you know it's me.

46
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:45,691
而是让你知道我没被动物吃掉
It's so you know I wasn't eaten by an animal.

47
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:48,278
那为什么信号是动物的声音呢？
Then why is the signal an animal noise?

48
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:50,138
我是说这难道不会使人产生误会？
Doesn't that just confuse things?

49
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:52,929
我还在等信号！
I don't know. I'm still waiting for the signal.

50
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,052
妈妈 我们可以走了！
Mom, we're ready to leave.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,119
妈妈？
Mom?

52
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,538
还没死呢！
Still alive.

53
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,618
还太早了
It's still early.

54
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:25,569
你还这么肥
And you're still fat.

55
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,958
排成早餐队形！
Breakfast formation!

56
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,673
给我拿出点洞穴人的样子来！动作要快！
I want to see some real caveman action out there. We do this fast.

57
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,586
声音要响 团结一致
We do this loud. We do this as a family.

58
00:04:37,673 --> 00:04:40,104
学会害怕！
And never not be afraid!

59
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,239
耶…早餐耶…
Yay, breakfast.

60
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,934
该谁了？
Who's up?

61
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,796
投姥姥决定 扔上去
We'll flip for it. Call her in the air.

62
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:21,952
正面
Heads!

63
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,859
反面 桑克上 就位！
Tails. Thunk is in. Positions.

64
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,441
好 桑克
Okay. Thunk...

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,308
去吧！
Go.

66
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,597
快去 桑克！
Come on, Thunk.

67
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,918
太棒了！把它带回洞里！
Way to go. Take it to the cave.

68
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,309
放孩子咬它！
Release the baby!

69
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,343
去吧 小沙 去吧！
Get them, Sandy! Go!

70
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,179
抓住他们 妈妈！
Get them, Mom!

71
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,047
老太太失手！小伊 替我报仇！
Old lady down! Eep, avenge me!

72
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,100
谢谢
Thanks.

73
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,568
小伊！
Eep!

74
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,824
接好！
Heads up!

75
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,518
爸爸 现在可以吃了吗？
Hey Dad, can we eat now?

76
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,568
回家再吃
Just wait till we get home.

77
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,477
小伊 过来踩煞车！
Eep, put on the brakes.

78
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,397
小伊！
Eep!

79
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,947
- 谁想吃？  - 干得好 爸爸
- Who is hungry? - All right! Good one, Dad.

80
00:08:38,947 --> 00:08:40,777
给你 桑克 喝吧
Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.

81
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,691
- 对不起 爸爸  - 看来得吃“快餐”了！
- Sorry, Dad. - Looks like fast food tonight.

82
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,686
没事儿 我上周吃过了
That's all right. I ate last week.

83
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,346
两指节征兆！
Two knuckle warning!

84
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,141
快回去
Come on, Croods. Go, go.

85
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,337
快点 快点 黑暗会带来死亡！洞穴人都知道
Come on, come on. Darkness brings death. We know this.

86
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,766
月圆之夜 该洗澡喽
The moon is full. Bath night.

87
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:24,695
- 逃命去！  - 休想跑 妈妈
- Run for your life! - You too, Mom.

88
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,798
我不想丢掉保护层！
I don't want to lose my protective layer.

89
00:09:27,798 --> 00:09:29,351
妈妈 你都生蚂蚁了
Mom, you've got ants.

90
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,357
看 小沙都不跑
See? Sandy doesn't fuss.

91
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,950
她还在外面？
Is she still out there?

92
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,867
你知道她讨厌呆在洞里 古勒格
You know she hates the cave, Grug.

93
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,562
明天还要来哦
Please come back tomorrow.

94
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:12,911
她怎么能不爱洞穴呢？这么温馨
How could she not like the cave? It's so cozy.

95
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:16,618
有点黑 不是吗？
It is a little dark, Grug.

96
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:18,132
没那么黑啦
It's not that dark.

97
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,376
小伊！
Eep!

98
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,981
小伊！
Eep?

99
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,376
快点 我要关门了
Come on, I have to close the cave.

100
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,375
小伊！
Eep!

101
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,369
知道啦 来啦！
Okay, okay.

102
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,982
快点
Come on.

103
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,137
小伊 下来！
Eep! Come down!

104
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,785
- 太险了！  - 我看着呢 我没事
- That was too close. - I was watching. I was fine.

105
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,901
- 你去上面干什么 小伊？  - 不知道
- What were you doing up there, Eep? - I don't know.

106
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,420
- 你去找什么？  - 没什么
- What were you looking for? - Nothing.

107
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,377
- 那你为什么上去？  - 不知道！
- Then why did you go up there? - I don't know.

108
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,434
为什么不知道？
Why don't you know?

109
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,761
别找东西了！
Stop looking for things.

110
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:38,356
恐惧让我们活下来 小伊 永远要懂得害怕
Fear keeps us alive, Eep. Never not be afraid.

111
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,170
这一切有什么意义？
What is the point of all this?

112
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,680
你说什么？
What was that?

113
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,042
我们为什么在这儿？我们这么做是为了什么？
Why are we here? What are we doing this for?

114
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,320
没人说过求生是好玩的
No one said survival was fun.

115
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,711
没有什么是好玩的
Nothing is fun.

116
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,012
- 你能不能下来 小伊？  - 古勒格？
- Would you come down here? - Grug.

117
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,727
- 小伊  - 古勒格
- Eep. - Grug.

118
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:56,769
- 好  - 下来了
- Yes. - Off!

119
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:58,727
- 好 我试过了  - 走开！
- Yes, I know. Okay, I'm trying to... - Off.

120
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:01,189
我只是不懂她为什么需要独自呆着
I just don't see why she needs her own ledge, that's all.

121
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:03,168
- 只是想问问  - 她在想事情
- That's what this is about. - She's working through some things...

122
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,949
需要自己的空间
and she needs her own space.

123
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,731
什么事？要多久？
What things? How long is this going to take?

124
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:10,141
真的吗？她都不听我说话了
Really? She already doesn't listen to me. Hey!

125
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:11,813
看 她听着呢
See? She's listening.

126
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:14,809
要想幸存她就得遵守规矩
If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules.

127
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:17,235
讲故事怎么样？小伊喜欢听故事
How about a story? Eep loves those.

128
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,106
好主意 想听故事吗？
That's a good ide... How about a story, huh?

129
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,408
好耶 快讲
Yeah, tell us a story.

130
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,255
好 借用一下 谢谢
Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.

131
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:28,222
小伊！你以前的最爱！
Eep, your old favorite.

132
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:30,631
我都好几年不玩了
I haven't played with that thing in years.

133
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:33,151
今晚我们讲干脆熊的故事
Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Bear.

134
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:37,676
很久很久以前 这只小熊还活着
A long time ago, this little bear was alive.

135
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:40,632
她活着因为她听爸爸的话
She was alive because she listened to her father...

136
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:44,314
在黑暗与恐惧中一成不变地生活着
and lived her life in routine and darkness and terror.

137
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,625
所以她很快乐
So she was happy.

138
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,285
但干脆熊有个致命的问题
But Krispy had one terrible problem.

139
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,722
她心中充满了…好奇
She was filled with... curiosity.

140
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,884
- 古勒格！  - 好 好
- Grug. - Yes. yes.

141
00:12:56,884 --> 00:13:00,030
有一天 当她在树上的时候
And one day, while she was in a tree...

142
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,385
这好奇的小熊想爬到树顶
the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top.

143
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:06,209
她刚爬到树顶
And no sooner than she climbed to the top...

144
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:10,459
就看见新奇的东西 然后就死了！
she saw something new and died!

145
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,411
- 就那样死了？  - 对！
- Just like that? - Yes!

146
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:17,255
她临死前的恐惧还凝结在脸上
Her last moments of terror still frozen on her face.

147
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,541
每天都一样的结局
Same ending as every day.

148
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,325
懂了 爸爸 我绝不会尝试新事物的
I get it, Dad. I will never do anything new or different.

149
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:22,679
好孩子 桑克
Good man, Thunk.

150
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:25,391
好了 大家磨磨牙 叠一块儿睡觉吧
All right, everyone sharpen your teeth, and let's pile up.

151
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,556
憋死我了
Air.

152
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:03,003
你会说话
You talk.

153
00:18:03,003 --> 00:18:04,835
我也是人 像你一样
I'm a person, like you.

154
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,789
和你…差不多吧
Sort of like you.

155
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,702
行了
Okay, okay.

156
00:18:13,702 --> 00:18:14,797
嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey, hey, hey!

157
00:18:14,797 --> 00:18:16,420
你能不能…
Would you mind not...

158
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,378
好痒啊
That tickles.

159
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:21,812
嘿 嘿 嘿！
Hey, hey, hey!

160
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,229
安静！
Quiet!

161
00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:28,097
我是偷偷跑出来的
I'm not supposed to be out here.

162
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,262
小伊不见了
Eep is gone.

163
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:43,671
什么？古勒格！
What? Grug!

164
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:44,660
呆在洞里别动！
Stay in the cave.

165
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,594
你真强壮
Wow. You are really strong.

166
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,900
不！那是我的！
Hey! No! It's mine.

167
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,194
- 求你了！  - 不！
- Please! Wait. - No!

168
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:06,019
- 快不行了 我能搞定  - 不！我发现的
- It's dying! I can fix it! - No! I caught it!

169
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,955
求你了
Please! Please.

170
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:09,456
我讨厌黑暗
I hate the dark.

171
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,850
来吧 来吧…
Come on, come on, come on.

172
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,747
它这么听话？
It does what you tell it?

173
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,385
嗯 算是吧
Yeah. Sort of.

174
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:29,678
是太阳？
The sun?

175
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,401
不 不 是火
No, no, no. Fire.

176
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,926
你好啊 火
Hi, fire.

177
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,315
它没有生命
It's not alive.

178
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,506
但你说它要不行了
But you said it was dying.

179
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,529
对不起
Sorry.

180
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,450
你们来自同一个地方？
It comes from where you come from?

181
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,363
不 我创造了它
No. No, I make it.

182
00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:51,255
- 那给我也弄点  - 好
- Make some for me. - Okay.

183
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:51,959
快点弄
Make!

184
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,871
它不在我身上
It doesn't come out of me.

185
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:55,816
快 快弄点！
Make! Make it!

186
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,950
你经常这么做吧
You do this a lot.

187
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,236
你死了吗？
Are you dead?

188
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,061
你要是死了我能拿你的火吗？
Can I have your fire if you're dead?

189
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,293
好凉的！
Hey, those are cold!

190
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,519
你说呢？贝壳听筒 启动
You think? Listening shells, activate.

191
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,674
我想
I concur.

192
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,752
虎妞 我们得快点闪了
Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.

193
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,322
我还不认识你呢
I don't even know you.

194
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,945
我叫盖
I'm Guy.

195
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:26,021
盖？
Guy?

196
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:28,979
这是皮带猴 会做饭 会聊天 会导航
And this is Belt. Cook, conversationalist, navigator.

197
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,221
还能用来系裤子
Also, keeps my pants up.

198
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,380
什么是“系裤子”？
What are "pants up"?

199
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,253
你叫什么？
Who are you?

200
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,398
小伊
Eep.

201
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:38,663
告诉你 小伊 世界要毁灭了
Let me clarify, Eep. The world is ending.

202
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:39,628
什么？
What?

203
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:42,217
我称之为“世界末日”
I'm calling it "The End."

204
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,355
你怎么知道？
How do you know?

205
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,010
我看见了 正往这边来呢
I have seen it. It's coming this way.

206
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,181
首先 大地会摇晃开裂 然后所有东西都掉进去
First, the ground is going to shake. Then it breaks open. Everything falls in.

207
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:53,298
火 岩浆
Fire. Lava.

208
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:54,840
我不想太夸张 但…
I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but...

209
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,710
相信我 现在我们脚下的一切都将不复存在
Believe me, everything we are standing on will be gone.

210
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,433
我们得去高地 我知道有座山 在那边
We got to get to high ground. I know a mountain, that way.

211
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,561
这是我们唯一的机会
It's our only chance.

212
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,795
和我一起来吧
Come with me.

213
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,543
不行
I can't.

214
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,893
好吧
Okay.

215
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,085
给
Here.

216
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,995
如果你活下来了 呼我
If you survive, call me.

217
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,623
谢谢
Thank you.

218
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,873
人呢？
Hello?

219
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,648
嘿
Hey!

220
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,138
爸爸！
Dad!

221
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:39,026
你没事吧？什么把你抓来的？
Are you hurt? What took you?

222
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:41,253
什么都不是 我自己上来的
Nothing. I left on my own.

223
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,730
你什么？
You what?

224
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,515
爸爸 听我解释
Dad, let me explain.

225
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,710
你从来不让我说话
You never let me talk.

226
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,710
我要关你禁闭
You're grounded.

227
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,420
嘿
Hey!

228
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,470
小伊！
Eep!

229
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,780
妈妈！
Mom.

230
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,380
古勒格！怎么回事？
Grug! What happened?

231
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,830
气死我了 我不想和她说话
You know what, I am so mad right now that I can't talk to her.

232
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,150
小伊？
Eep?

233
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,709
你不会相信的 我发现了新事物
You will never believe it. I found something new.

234
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,453
新事物？
New!

235
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:18,021
新事物会造成大问题
New is a big problem!

236
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:18,798
等等 等等
Wait, wait!

237
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:21,127
小伊 给我呆在绝杀圈里
Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.

238
00:22:21,127 --> 00:22:23,444
- 但它并没有不好啊  - 新东西总是不好的
- It wasn't bad. - "New" is always bad.

239
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:24,612
不 他人很好
No. He was nice.

240
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,656
什么？“他”？
What? Excuse me? He?

241
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:31,027
我一开始以为他是头野猪 但接着他变成了个男孩
I thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy.

242
00:22:31,027 --> 00:22:32,233
好奇怪
Strange.

243
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:34,141
通常是相反的情况
Usually it's the reverse.

244
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:36,884
小伊找了个猪男友！小伊找了个猪男友！
Eep's got a boy hog. Eep's got a boy...

245
00:22:36,884 --> 00:22:38,318
是真的 好吗？
There was a boy.

246
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:40,255
我这就叫他
Watch. I'm going to call him.

247
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,125
你们都怎么了？
What is wrong with you?

248
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,722
这很危险
It was dangerous.

249
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,527
这很漂亮
It was beautiful!

250
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:04,711
知道什么是危险吗？看着
You want to see dangerous? Here!

251
00:23:04,711 --> 00:23:07,320
我的鼻子！
My sniffer!

252
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,522
小伊 够了
Okay, that's it!

253
00:23:08,522 --> 00:23:09,557
我们回洞里去
We're going back to the cave...

254
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:12,502
你给我一直呆着直到…
and you're going to stay in there until you're older than...

255
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:15,206
你比她还大！
her!

256
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:16,061
什么？
What!

257
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:19,452
你休想一直把我关在洞里！
You can't keep me inside forever!

258
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,110
他说过会这样
He said this would happen.

259
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,431
快回洞里去
Get to the cave!

260
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,580
快！
Go!

261
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,282
小心！
Look out!

262
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,922
停！
Stop!

263
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,663
大家都没事吧？
Is everyone okay?

264
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,747
没事
Yes.

265
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,068
古勒格 山洞…
Grug, the cave...

266
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,206
没了
it's gone.

267
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,159
不
No.

268
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,961
快看
You really need to see this.

269
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,901
我们得去那儿！
We should go there!

270
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:09,038
不 不 哪儿都不许去
No. No one is going anywhere.

271
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,663
那小子还说了什么？
What else did that boy say?

272
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,725
古勒格？
Grug?

273
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,692
快走！
Just go! Just go!

274
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,795
快！
Go!

275
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,854
一 二 三 四 五…
One, two, three, four, five...

276
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,168
六
Six.

277
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,169
我们在哪儿？
Where are we?

278
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:16,117
我不知道
I don't know. I'm not sure.

279
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,638
在下面
Down.

280
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,831
一个更低的地方
In a lower place.

281
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:23,885
不过可以确定我们无法原路返回了
But one thing is for sure, we can't go back the way we came.

282
00:27:25,473 --> 00:27:27,499
小沙？是什么？
Sandy? What is it?

283
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,138
不 不 等等 回来 小沙
No, no, no. Wait. Come back, Sandy!

284
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,050
我们不能这么在外面呆着
We can't be out in the open like this.

285
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,500
我们需要找个山洞
We need a cave.

286
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,712
踩着我的脚印走
Now, step where I step.

287
00:27:47,712 --> 00:27:50,639
好了 不要出声
Okay. Stay quiet.

288
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:52,894
希望不要被大动物察觉
Hopefully, nothing big knows we're here yet.

289
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,800
等等！
Wait.

290
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,133
好了
Okay.

291
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,458
等等！
Wait.

292
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,205
好了
Okay.

293
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,719
等等！
Wait!

294
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,041
等等！
Wait.

295
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,764
好了
Okay.

296
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,024
等等！
Wait.

297
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,315
等等
Wait.

298
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,837
爸爸
So, Dad...

299
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,852
只想确定一下 我们要找一模一样的山洞吗？
just to be clear, are we looking for the exact same cave?

300
00:28:42,852 --> 00:28:45,632
如果是我…我是说如果
If it was me... I'm just throwing this out there...

301
00:28:45,632 --> 00:28:47,335
让我选山洞
if it was me choosing the cave...

302
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,033
我会选个小点儿的
I would go with a smaller cave.

303
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,490
等等！
Wait.

304
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,604
爸爸！
Dad?

305
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,206
我来搞定
I'll take care of this.

306
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,256
来吧 爸爸 揍它们
All right, Dad, get them! Go get them!

307
00:29:14,256 --> 00:29:15,665
你把它们…
Now you got them right...

308
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,666
它们真…
Man, they're really...

309
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,853
太爽了！
I'm loving this.

310
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,603
爸爸 我懂了
Dad, I got it.

311
00:29:20,603 --> 00:29:22,393
别老往它们拳头上撞！
Just stop running into their fists.

312
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,333
古勒格 你爽够了我们就上路吧
Grug, when you're done, we should get going.

313
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,339
对了！知道敌不过这个吧！
That's right. You can't get past this!

314
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,923
爬！爬！快爬！
Climb! Climb! Climb!

315
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,995
有山洞！
Cave!

316
00:30:06,995 --> 00:30:08,000
快！快！
Go! Go!

317
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,999
快走 快点！走！赶紧！
Come on! Hurry up. Let's go.

318
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,342
快看！这山洞有舌头耶！太酷了！
Look! This cave has a tongue. Awesome!

319
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,555
好了
Okay.

320
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,418
一 二 三 四 五 六…
That's one, two, three, four, five, six.

321
00:30:38,418 --> 00:30:40,138
七
And seven...

322
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,910
如果算上这只死肥猫的话
if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.

323
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,366
它怕黑！
It's scared of the dark.

324
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,791
等等 我们也怕黑！
Wait, we're scared of the dark.

325
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,093
绝杀阵型！
Kill circle!

326
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,534
小伊！
Eep!

327
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,231
小伊！
Eep!

328
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,990
- 是洞人！  - 洞人？
- Cavies! - "Cavies"?

329
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,571
就是穴居人！退后！他们和野兽没什么分别
Cavemen! Stand back! They're practically animals.

330
00:33:15,571 --> 00:33:18,289
- 看见他们多骨 倾斜的前额了？  - 嗯！
- You see their bony, sloping foreheads? - Yeah.

331
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,281
原始的大獠牙？
The huge primitive teeth?

332
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,005
嗯
Yeah.

333
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,285
过多的体毛？
The excessive body hair.

334
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:25,597
这个还有尾巴！
That one has got a tail.

335
00:33:25,597 --> 00:33:26,702
嗯
Yeah.

336
00:33:26,702 --> 00:33:29,691
好了 闭上眼睛 我要杀了他们
All right. Close your eyes. I'm going to have to take their lives.

337
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:32,716
不 不行 他们是我家人
No! It won't help. They're my family.

338
00:33:32,716 --> 00:33:33,449
什么？
What?

339
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,795
太阳在他手中！
The sun is in his hands!

340
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:39,266
不 不 是火！
No, no. It's "fire."

341
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:40,762
哪儿来的？
Where did it come from?

342
00:33:40,762 --> 00:33:42,009
他造的
He made it.

343
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,327
给我整点！
Make some for me!

344
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:45,108
他身上不产这个
It doesn't come out of him.

345
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:46,621
整啊！整点儿！
Make. Make it!

346
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:50,384
你可真像你女儿
You're a lot like your daughter.

347
00:33:50,384 --> 00:33:52,324
好了 现在他被你整坏了！
Great, now he's broken.

348
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,235
是小太阳！
It's a baby sun.

349
00:33:54,235 --> 00:33:57,011
退后！我们不知道它想要什么
Hey, stay back. We don't know what it wants.

350
00:33:57,011 --> 00:34:00,235
现在我们坐在这儿等太阳回来
Now, we'll all sit here and wait for the sun to come back.

351
00:34:00,235 --> 00:34:02,780
明天我们找个新山洞
And tomorrow we'll find a new cave...

352
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,650
假装今天什么都没发生过
and pretend today never happened.

353
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,858
这有意思吧 小伊？
Isn't this fun, Eep?

354
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:08,389
小伊 别碰他！
Eep, don't touch him.

355
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:10,101
谁知道他去过哪儿
Goodness knows where he's been.

356
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:11,720
爸爸 小沙在弄火！
Dad, Sandy is hurting fire.

357
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,355
小沙！不！火不是用来玩的
Sandy, no. Fire is not a plaything.

358
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:17,471
多可爱的小伙子啊
What a cute little guy.

359
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:18,504
退后！
Hey. Stay back.

360
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:22,426
不 不 不 等等！
No, no, no, wait!

361
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,084
它喜欢我！
It likes me.

362
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,790
它在咬我！
Hey! It's biting me!

363
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,139
桑克！快去干草丛里躲躲！
Thunk! Try hiding from it in the tall, dry grass!

364
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,881
别这样 求你了！我才九岁！
No, stop. Please, I'm only nine.

365
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:41,176
它还在咬我！
They're biting me!

366
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,103
火宝宝！
More fire babies.

367
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,663
你爸爸刚才想杀了我
So, your dad, he is trying to kill me.

368
00:34:50,663 --> 00:34:52,761
对 但我不会让他得逞的
Yeah. But I won't let him.

369
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,249
挺住 儿子 回来！
Hold on, son. Come back!

370
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,559
它停不了 别碰我！
No, stop! Let me go!

371
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,655
滚开！
Get out! Out! Out!

372
00:35:02,655 --> 00:35:04,847
尽情地吃吧 宝宝们！
Eat up, babies!

373
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,782
别碰我！
No, stop touching me!

374
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,143
要死了！
Die!

375
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,353
我赢了！
I win!

376
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,169
一旦了解了他们就不觉得可怕了
They're not so scary once you get to know them.

377
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,604
你们到底是谁？
Who are you people?

378
00:35:26,604 --> 00:35:27,850
忘介绍了
I'm sorry.

379
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,064
我们是克鲁家族！
We're the Croods!

380
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,760
你是？
And you are?

381
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,599
我叫盖
Guy.

382
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,457
嗨  盖
Hi, Guy.

383
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,967
哇
Wow!

384
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,935
看起来像变戏法！
It looks like magic.

385
00:35:51,935 --> 00:35:53,966
闻起来很好吃耶
And smells like food.

386
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,542
别吃 是新事物
No, don't eat it, it's new.

387
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,814
还活着！
Still alive!

388
00:36:08,814 --> 00:36:10,201
来吧 继续吃！
Come on, keep eating.

389
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,931
盖呢？
Hey, where is Guy?

390
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,735
不！
No!

391
00:36:23,735 --> 00:36:24,757
要去哪儿啊？
Going somewhere?

392
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:27,626
上山 上高地 世界末日 记得吗？
The mountain? High ground? End of the world, remember?

393
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:30,824
早发生了 毁了我们的山洞
That already happened. It destroyed our cave.

394
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:33,465
不 那只是末日的开始
No. That was just the beginning of the end.

395
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:35,906
结尾还没来呢
The end of the end is still coming.

396
00:36:35,906 --> 00:36:38,033
小伊 放下他
Eep. Drop it.

397
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,461
我们不能让他走！
We can't let him go!

398
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,728
万一日落前我们没找到山洞怎么办？
What if we don't find a cave before sunset?

399
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,912
万一要找好几天怎么办？
What if it takes a few days?

400
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,053
万一那些鸟回来了怎么办？
What if the birds come back?

401
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,986
我们需要他的火 呆瓜！
We need his fire, dummy!

402
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,633
好吧 在找到山洞前你和我们呆在一起
Fine. You're staying with us until we find a cave.

403
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:03,025
什么？不 不行！放了我吧
What? No, I'm not. Don't make me a part of this!

404
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,353
你们愿意就留下 放了我
Stay here if you want, but let me go.

405
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:06,442
我有理想
I've got a dream...

406
00:37:06,442 --> 00:37:08,583
有使命 有活着的理由！
a mission, a reason to live!

407
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:09,771
现在没了！
Not anymore.

408
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:11,769
有了
I've got an idea.

409
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,404
我们去那座山吧
Let's go to that mountain.

410
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,988
太远
It's too far.

411
00:37:14,988 --> 00:37:18,057
爸爸只想着山洞
Dad really has his heart set on a cave.

412
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,446
那山上有山洞
There are caves on that mountain.

413
00:37:21,446 --> 00:37:22,640
你去过？
Have you been there?

414
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,196
山嘛
It's a mountain.

415
00:37:24,196 --> 00:37:26,427
很安全 有山洞
Mountains are safe. Mountains have caves.

416
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,754
水 手杖
And water. And sticks.

417
00:37:28,754 --> 00:37:31,605
妈妈 你听见了吗？我能有自己的手杖了！
Mom? Did you hear that? I can get my own stick!

418
00:37:31,605 --> 00:37:34,272
没错 手杖 还有山洞 山洞 手杖
Yes. Sticks and caves. Caves and sticks.

419
00:37:34,272 --> 00:37:35,350
神奇的手杖 走吧
Crazy sticks. Let's go.

420
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,020
别出声！
Quiet!

421
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,442
那东西好奇怪
That thing is weird.

422
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,290
别 别 别 没事 小沙
No, no, no. It's okay, Sandy.

423
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,866
那只是皮带猴
That's just Belt.

424
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,960
我决定了
I've made a decision.

425
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,961
我们去那座山！
We're going to that mountain.

426
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,594
别问我为什么 只是直觉
Don't ask me why. Just a hunch.

427
00:38:05,594 --> 00:38:07,357
感觉那是对的
Just feels right.

428
00:38:07,357 --> 00:38:10,815
我不清楚 古勒格 我们从未走过那么远的路
I don't know, Grug. We've never really walked that far.

429
00:38:10,815 --> 00:38:12,891
我怕我的脚受不了
I don't think my feet can do that.

430
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:15,434
我怕我没法活着走到那
I'll never live long enough to get there.

431
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,746
那就上路吧
Let's do it.

432
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,148
来吧 想想
Come on, just think.

433
00:38:21,148 --> 00:38:25,069
一家人其乐融融地享受一段漫长缓慢的旅行
Our whole family packed together on a long, slow, trip across country?

434
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,244
朝夕相处 亲密无间
Days and nights with just each other.

435
00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:29,186
充满了故事和欢笑
We'll tell stories. We'll laugh.

436
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,743
我们会更爱彼此
We'll become closer as a family.

437
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,425
让她下去！
Get her off!

438
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,747
如果你没准备好和她打 就不要看她的眼睛
If you're not ready to challenge her, then don't look her in the eye.

439
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,365
你能看好自己的大胳膊吗？别老撞我！
Could you keep your big giant arms on your side of the trail?

440
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,799
这有趣吧？我们第一次一起旅行
Isn't this fun? We're taking our first trip together.

441
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,492
别推我 否则揪掉你舌头！
Stop shoving, or I will pull out your tongue!

442
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,892
你想让我们掉头回去？想吗？
Do you want me to turn this family around? Do you?

443
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,769
我立即就可以让大家打道回府！
Because I will turn this family around so fast!

444
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,265
爸爸 我要嘘嘘！
Dad, I gotta go!

445
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:57,745
- 得了 你能憋住的  - 憋不住
- Come on, you can hold it. - I don't think so.

446
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,380
小沙 把它吐出来
Sandy, take that out of your mouth.

447
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,941
我在摸…
I'm touching...

448
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,446
爸爸 我还是想尿！
Dad, I still gotta go!

449
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,523
好吧 别闹了 那你快点
Fine. Just go behind one of those lumpy things and make it fast.

450
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,622
- 有东西咬我  - 活该！
- Something bit me! - I don't blame it.

451
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,227
爸爸 我能扛他吗？
Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?

452
00:39:11,227 --> 00:39:11,941
不行
No.

453
00:39:11,941 --> 00:39:13,448
- 现在呢？  - 不行！
- How about now? - No.

454
00:39:13,448 --> 00:39:14,968
- 现在呢？  - 不行！
- Now? - No.

455
00:39:14,968 --> 00:39:15,595
现在呢？
Now?

456
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,026
我可以扛一整天
I can do this all day long.

457
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,630
不行 还是不行！
No, no, no and still no.

458
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,241
我可不想当饿死鬼
I'm not dying on an empty stomach.

459
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,581
古勒格 我们都要累死了
Grug, we're all pretty tired!

460
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,969
等到那就吃饭
We'll eat when we get there.

461
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,514
等不及了！
It's taking too long!

462
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,554
我先吃点点心
I'm grabbing a snack.

463
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,233
别！他会刺你的
Don't do that. He will cut you.

464
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:36,277
他不是食物 是宠物 我的宠物
That's not food, he's a pet. My pet.

465
00:39:36,277 --> 00:39:37,594
什么是宠物？
What's a pet?

466
00:39:37,594 --> 00:39:39,118
你不能吃的动物
An animal you don't eat.

467
00:39:39,118 --> 00:39:41,704
我们只是不吃小孩儿
We call those "children."

468
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,139
养什么宠物 让人搞不懂
No man should have a pet. It's weird and wrong.

469
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,253
- 那是…食物！  - 不 求你了！
- It's food! - No, please!

470
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,977
不是他 是那里！
Not that. That!

471
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,180
有食物就能解决一切
Food fixes everything.

472
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,201
进入狩猎状态
Show me your hunting face.

473
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,973
不是你！你还在关禁闭
Not you. You're still grounded.

474
00:39:59,973 --> 00:40:00,867
来吧 桑克
Come on, Thunk.

475
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,590
我脚疼
My feet hurt.

476
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,168
- 你挺紧张啊  - 我不紧张
- You look tense. - I'm not tense.

477
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,492
气呼呼的女孩想参与狩猎
Angry girl wants to be doing what they're doing.

478
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,538
我还没准备好
I wasn't ready.

479
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,886
坚持住 桑克 我来了
Hang on, Thunk, I'm coming!

480
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:21,296
为什么老追我？
Why are you doing this?

481
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,431
他们在干什么？
What are they doing?

482
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:25,124
狩猎
Hunting.

483
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,764
离我远点！
Get it off! You stay away from me.

484
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:29,288
别蒙我了 他们到底在干吗？
No, seriously, what are they doing?

485
00:40:29,288 --> 00:40:32,293
你那么多蛋呢 再下一个不就得了！
You've got a ton of eggs. Just make another egg.

486
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,751
你还觉得我不够惨是不？
Now you're just rubbing it in.

487
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,276
来吧 谁想吃蝎子？
There, who's hungry for scorpion?

488
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,480
鸟和蛋呢？
What happened to the egg and the bird?

489
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,180
没逮到
We lost him.

490
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,145
但是当鸟落在我身上把我轧进地里时
But when the bird stepped on me and pushed me into the ground...

491
00:41:03,145 --> 00:41:04,581
这蝎子过来占便宜
the scorpion grabbed a hold of me...

492
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:07,739
一事生一事 结果它反倒成了我们的盘中餐
and one thing led to another and here we are eating him.

493
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:08,875
双赢啊
So, win-win.

494
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:11,554
不够吃 不够吃 我还要！
Not enough. Not enough! I need more.

495
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:14,598
我还要！
I need more.

496
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,713
快看 她不会吃我吧？
Look at that. She's not going to eat me, right?

497
00:41:17,713 --> 00:41:18,814
你太瘦了
You're too skinny.

498
00:41:18,814 --> 00:41:21,003
如果她想吃人 她会选…
If she was going to eat anyone it would be...

499
00:41:21,003 --> 00:41:21,815
妈妈！
Mom!

500
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,970
她不松嘴！
She's locked her jaw!

501
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,657
用手杖
Get a stick! Get a stick!

502
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,293
滚开！
Stay away!

503
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,488
你这个变态的老禽兽！
You sick old monster!

504
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:33,099
快！用手杖撬开她的嘴！
Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!

505
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,974
稳住她 用石头砸
Hold her still. Use a rock.

506
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,677
快砸她的腿啊！
Ugga, would you just hit her legs?

507
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,894
为什么滚走哪？
Why are you rolling away?

508
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,240
我就想找点吃的去！
I just want something to eat.

509
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,293
你就吃虫子吧 管够！
You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!

510
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,633
求你了！
Please.

511
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,198
我让你帮我狩猎
I'll let you help me hunt.

512
00:41:52,198 --> 00:41:52,934
真的？
Really?

513
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,341
别管我了！
Don't wait on me. They're all over me.

514
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,013
把我的传说流传下去
Tell my story.

515
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,904
好了
Okay.

516
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,579
你管这个叫什么？
What do you call this?

517
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:10,072
陷阱
A trap.

518
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:11,226
会怎样？
What does it do?

519
00:42:11,226 --> 00:42:12,058
呃
Well...

520
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,175
你这么寂寞有多久了？
How long have you been alone?

521
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:29,821
接下来我们干什么？
So, what do we do?

522
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,319
你的演技怎么样？
How's your acting?

523
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,039
不错啊
You're good at this.

524
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,408
对不起
No. Sorry.

525
00:43:05,408 --> 00:43:06,758
没事
Okay.

526
00:43:06,758 --> 00:43:09,064
- 那是你的  - 抱歉
- Yeah, that's yours. - Excuse me.

527
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,998
另一只手
Your other hand...

528
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,936
- 那是我的手！  - 好 我拿开…
- That's my arm. - Okay, I'm moving it.

529
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,034
它没踩到你的陷阱
It didn't step in your trapything.

530
00:43:28,034 --> 00:43:30,891
对 我发现了
Yeah, I noticed!

531
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,783
小伊呢？
Where's Eep?

532
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,963
太牛了
She's awesome.

533
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,191
小伊！
Eep!

534
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,185
爸爸 不！
Dad, no!

535
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,888
味道真是棒极了！
It's an avalanche of flavor.

536
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,879
看来没有剩菜了
Looks like we won't be having any leftovers.

537
00:44:31,879 --> 00:44:33,775
剩菜是什么？
What are "left overs"?

538
00:44:33,775 --> 00:44:36,131
当食物过多的时候会剩下些的
When you have so much food to eat, you have some left over.

539
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,489
我们从来都没那么多食物的
We never have that much food.

540
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,271
古勒格 讲个故事吧？
Grug, how about a story?

541
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,170
好主意 讲个故事怎么样？
That's a good idea. How about a story?

542
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,292
耶 好耶！快讲啊！
Yeah, tell us a story!

543
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,566
从前有个小老虎
Once upon a time, there was a little tiger...

544
00:45:04,566 --> 00:45:07,383
和家人住在山洞里
who lived in a cave with her family.

545
00:45:07,383 --> 00:45:08,737
规矩有很多
There were a lot of rules...

546
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,770
但最简单最重要的一条是 绝不要在晚上离开山洞
but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night.

547
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,742
洞门很重 应该很容易记住的
And the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember.

548
00:45:18,742 --> 00:45:20,455
是啊 多容易啊
So easy to remember!

549
00:45:20,455 --> 00:45:21,465
我知道
I know.

550
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,741
但当大家都睡着的时候
But, while everyone was asleep...

551
00:45:24,741 --> 00:45:26,418
她还是跑了出去
she went out anyway.

552
00:45:26,418 --> 00:45:28,073
- 不！  - 没错！
- No! - Yes!

553
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:31,031
结果山洞马上就毁了
And no sooner than she did, their cave was destroyed...

554
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:33,673
大家不得不踏上一个漫长无聊的旅程
and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk...

555
00:45:33,673 --> 00:45:35,556
还遇到了一个怪小子
with some weirdo they met...

556
00:45:35,556 --> 00:45:37,988
最后全死了！
and die!

557
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,989
讲完了
The end.

558
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,047
这个揪心的结局好突然啊
I did not see that coming. Twist ending.

559
00:45:45,047 --> 00:45:46,870
我的故事可不会这样
My stories never end like that.

560
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,790
太棒了！今晚可以听两个故事！
Yes! Two stories in one night!

561
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,000
好吧 但我没古勒格讲得好
Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's.

562
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,023
从前 有一只美丽的小老虎
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger.

563
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,233
她和家人住在山洞里
She lived in a cave with the rest of her family.

564
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,162
她的父母告诉她去哪儿都行
Her father and mother told her, "You may go anywhere you want...

565
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,303
但千万别去悬崖 你会掉下去的
"but never go near the cliff, for you could fall."

566
00:46:20,303 --> 00:46:22,761
然后就死了 不错的故事
And die. Good story.

567
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,047
但当没人的时候
But when no one was looking...

568
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,340
她就会去悬崖
she'd go near the cliff...

569
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,103
因为她越靠近悬崖边
for the closer she came to the edge...

570
00:46:32,103 --> 00:46:35,350
她就会听到越多 看到越多
the more she could hear, the more she could see...

571
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,489
感受到越多的东西
the more she could feel.

572
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,325
最后
Finally...

573
00:46:41,325 --> 00:46:43,918
她站在了悬崖边上
she stood at the very edge.

574
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,174
她看见了亮光
She saw a light.

575
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,295
她伸手去摸
She leaned out to touch it...

576
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,395
她滑倒了
and she slipped.

577
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,897
她掉下去了
And she fell.

578
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,154
她飞起来了
And she flew.

579
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,962
她飞向哪儿了？
Where did she fly?

580
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,557
明天
Tomorrow.

581
00:47:00,557 --> 00:47:01,798
明天？
Tomorrow?

582
00:47:01,798 --> 00:47:05,108
一个天空中挂满了太阳的地方
A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.

583
00:47:05,108 --> 00:47:06,528
那得老亮了
It would be so bright.

584
00:47:06,528 --> 00:47:09,237
一个与今天和昨天都不同的地方
A place not like today, or yesterday.

585
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,252
一个更加美好的地方
A place where things are better.

586
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,737
明天不是个地方
Tomorrow isn't a place.

587
00:47:15,737 --> 00:47:18,320
你看不见的
You can't see it!

588
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,401
可以的
Yes, it is.

589
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,165
我见过
I've seen it.

590
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,573
那就是我要去的地方
That's where I'm going.

591
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:40,597
好了 我们该闭眼睛睡觉了
We are going to shut our eyes and sleep.

592
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,996
睡醒后
And when we wake up...

593
00:47:41,996 --> 00:47:44,635
我们就去寻找那片传说中的乐土
we're going to find the place that has everything we want.

594
00:47:44,635 --> 00:47:45,629
是明天？
Tomorrow?

595
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:46,699
是山洞
A cave.

596
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,166
太险了 差点就玩完了
That was too close. It almost caught us.

597
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:30,241
我看着呢 没事呢
I was watching. We were fine.

598
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,344
我们得走快点儿
We gotta move faster.

599
00:48:31,344 --> 00:48:34,574
你们除了闲逛模式还有别的速度吗？
Do you people have any other speed aside from "wander"?

600
00:48:34,574 --> 00:48:36,783
要是我这时就会快起来
I'll take a shamble at this point.

601
00:48:36,783 --> 00:48:38,549
嘿 你有空吗？
Hey, do you have a minute?

602
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,789
老虎怎么飞起来的？
How did the tiger fly?

603
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:43,300
在树桩里我不想讲
I only share when I'm outside the log.

604
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,918
出来讲才好玩
I'm funny that way.

605
00:48:44,918 --> 00:48:47,501
这交给我吧
Leave this to me.

606
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,975
桑克
Hey, Thunk...

607
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,983
你脸上有蜘蛛
you have a spider on your face.

608
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,210
他跑了！
He's loose!

609
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,792
别踩这些奇怪的尖石头！
Do not step on those weird pointy rocks.

610
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:07,025
你是说这些？
Do you mean these rocks?

611
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,262
怎么能不踩这些石头？
Do not step on these rocks!

612
00:49:10,262 --> 00:49:11,600
站到边上去 丫头
Step aside, girls.

613
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,240
嘿 没人在听！没人在听！
Hello? Nobody's listening! No one is listening.

614
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,163
你们不能踩！
You cannot walk on those!

615
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,430
回来！回来！
Get back here now!

616
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,919
我们逃生的希望跑了
There goes our chance for survival.

617
00:49:37,919 --> 00:49:39,254
还有我们的树桩！
And our log!

618
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,417
好吧！
Okay.

619
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,580
跳起来也没用 起来时不疼
Jumping doesn't help. It does briefly...

620
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,403
落下来就疼了！
but it doesn't get better.

621
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,557
不要用手 也不起作用！
Don't walk on your hands. The hands do not help at all.

622
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,259
走吧
Come on.

623
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,431
我可以帮你们
I can help you...

624
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,399
但规矩得改改
but we're going to have to make a few changes around here.

625
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,548
树桩之旅结束了
The log ride is over.

626
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:31,215
扔掉树桩
Drop the log.

627
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,441
踢一边去
Now, kick it away.

628
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,811
远点
Farther.

629
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,688
真远哪
Really?

630
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,770
好了 聪明的盖
Okay, smart "Guy"...

631
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,268
现在呢？
now what?

632
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,337
好鱼鱼 好鱼鱼
Good fish, good fish.

633
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,510
好了 你可以睁开眼睛了
Okay. Now you can look.

634
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,163
好喜欢！但我的脚呢？
I love them! Where are my feet?

635
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,003
还在呢
They're still there!

636
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,076
好吧
Okay.

637
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,054
你真沉啊
You're really heavy.

638
00:51:30,054 --> 00:51:30,867
是吗？
Really?

639
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,597
谢谢
Thank you!

640
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,247
等等！
Hey. Wait!

641
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,630
好
Okay.

642
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,510
她起来了 没事了 我没事
She's up. We're good. I'm good.

643
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,300
这些鞋太棒了！你怎么想到的？
These shoes are great! Where do you get these ideas?

644
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,390
我管它叫脑子
I'm calling it a "brain."

645
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,860
我确信主意就是从这里产生的
I'm pretty sure it's where ideas come from.

646
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,070
爸爸 我没有脑子
Dad, I don't have a brain.

647
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,510
没脑子我们不也好好活到了现在
We've gotten along just fine without brains until now.

648
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,870
洞穴人不需要脑子 我们有这个
Cavemen don't need brains. We have these.

649
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,310
我们要的是这个 弱者才需要想点子！
That's what I'm talking about! Ideas are for weaklings.

650
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,710
我们去那座山吧
Now, let's get to that mountain!

651
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,030
太好看了
Wow! I love those!

652
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,390
好鱼鱼 别吃我的脚
Good fish. Don't eat my feet.

653
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:58,280
老虎是怎么飞起来的呢？
So, how did the tiger fly?

654
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,030
她跳上了太阳
She jumped on the sun...

655
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,910
骑着它飞到了明天
and rode it to Tomorrow.

656
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,870
不 不 不！
No, no, no.

657
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,500
嗨 爸爸！
Hi, Dad!

658
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,470
拜拜 爸爸
Bye, Dad!

659
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,830
你们应该见过下雨吧？
You've seen rain before, right?

660
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,270
我们不经常外出
We don't get out much.

661
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,830
小伊 看起来很危险
Eep, looks dangerous.

662
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,030
爸爸 你看什么都很危险
Dad, you say that about everything.

663
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,180
小心啊
Careful.

664
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,670
是吗？那好
Really? Okay.

665
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,710
不 不 不 不行啊！
No, no, no. Not cool!

666
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,390
- 那熊说：你的洞？我上星期就在这儿放骨头了,上星期!
 So, the bear says, "Your cave? I've been dumping my bones here since last week."

667
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,870
真是个有意思的故事！
That's a funny story!

668
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,110
这不是故事 是笑话
It's not a story. It's a joke.

669
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,550
什么是笑话？
What's a "joke"?

670
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,750
就是编点东西使你发笑
Just making something up to make you laugh.

671
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,100
- 给你  - 谢谢
- One for you. - Thanks.

672
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,230
给你一个 这个给你…
One for you. And this one's for you.

673
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,940
行了
Okay.

674
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,950
行了 够了
Okay! That's enough!

675
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,812
大家为什么需要这些贝壳？
I don't see why the kids need their own shells.

676
00:55:49,812 --> 00:55:52,101
如果有人碰上了麻烦 可以向别人求救
So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call the others.

677
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:54,766
等等 你说我们要分开？
Wait, you're saying we should split up?

678
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,724
这样我们可以一次试更多的路
We can try more paths at once.

679
00:55:56,724 --> 00:55:58,299
这是最快的方法了
It's the fastest way through.

680
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,832
克鲁家从不分开 你的方法不安全
Croods stick together. Your way isn't safe.

681
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:01,991
他们没事儿的
They can handle it.

682
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,146
我们能行的 爸爸
We can do it, Dad.

683
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,750
不 不 不
No, no, no.

684
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,389
我是负责你们安全的
It's my job to keep you safe.

685
00:56:07,389 --> 00:56:10,254
我说了算 我们不会分开的
I'm still in charge and we are not splitting up.

686
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,665
你俩得分开
Except for you two.

687
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,407
就这么定了
And that's final.

688
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,785
喂？
Hello?

689
00:56:35,785 --> 00:56:37,332
大家都好吗？
Is everyone all right?

690
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,391
我们都好 古勒格！
We're okay, Grug.

691
00:56:39,391 --> 00:56:41,687
爸爸？我有点害怕
Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit.

692
00:56:41,687 --> 00:56:44,405
告诉我该怎么做 我该咋办啊？
Just tell me what to do. What do I do? What do I do right now?

693
00:56:44,405 --> 00:56:46,466
留在原地别动！我去找你
Stay where you are. I'll find you.

694
00:56:46,466 --> 00:56:48,211
不！那样太慢了
No. Too slow.

695
00:56:48,211 --> 00:56:51,256
大家都往前走 我们会出去的
Everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out.

696
00:56:51,256 --> 00:56:52,158
爸爸？
Dad?

697
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,326
哎
Yeah.

698
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,237
好吧
Okay.

699
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,077
记住 不要不害怕
Remember, never not be afraid.

700
00:57:00,077 --> 00:57:01,758
你能行的！
You can do this!

701
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,152
没事儿的
It's going to be okay, it's going to be okay.

702
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,498
我要昏过去了
I'm going to pass out.

703
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,731
小沙！小沙！
Sandy. Sandy!

704
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,564
再给我一个
Give me another one.

705
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,564
你扔的吧
You dropped these.

706
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,401
跟我走吧
Come with me.

707
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,270
嘿 小子 接住！
Here, boy! Catch!

708
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,224
外婆？
Gran?

709
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,535
妈妈？
Mom?

710
00:59:55,535 --> 00:59:56,760
哇
Wow.

711
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,266
古勒格呢？
Grug?

712
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,836
我去找他
I'll go get him.

713
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,995
好孩子 谁是好孩子？
Good boy! Who's a good boy?

714
01:00:17,995 --> 01:00:19,798
你是 没错 就是你 看看你
You are! Yes, you are! Look at you!

715
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:21,690
你要名字吗？
You need a name. You want a name?

716
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,731
我叫你道格拉斯
I'm going to call you Douglas.

717
01:00:23,731 --> 01:00:26,229
你会演节目吗？滚一圈
Can you do tricks? Roll over.

718
01:00:26,229 --> 01:00:27,890
来吧 道格拉斯 滚一圈
Come on, Douglas, roll over.

719
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,168
好样的 道格拉斯！
Good boy, Douglas!

720
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,394
我爱上过一个人
I was in love once.

721
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,455
他是猎人 我是采集食物的
He was a hunter. I was a gatherer.

722
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,893
当时闹得满城风雨呢
It was quite a scandal.

723
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,470
我们彼此喂果子吃 一起跳舞
We fed each other berries, we danced.

724
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:53,796
后来我爸爸用石头砸死了他 把我卖给了你们的外公
Then my father smashed him with a rock and traded me to your grandfather.

725
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,634
克鲁家的
Croods!

726
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,751
都下来！
Get down here.

727
01:01:01,751 --> 01:01:04,654
古勒格 他们挺好的 和盖在一起
Grug, they're okay. Guy is with them.

728
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,337
和盖在一起 好
Guy is with them. Okay.

729
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,958
谢谢
Thank you.

730
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:12,986
谢谢你告诉我那个盖的最新情况
Thank you for bringing me that interesting Guy update.

731
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,217
好了 我要上去了
Okay. I'm going to go up...

732
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:19,650
等你不烦人了就上来和我们一起吧
and why don't you join us when you stop being a big drag!

733
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,301
要叠睡吗？
Sleep pile?

734
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,550
要听故事吗？
How about a story?

735
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,565
有人要吗？
Anyone?

736
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,675
托克说：知道 是我画的
And then Torg said, "Know it? I drew it."

737
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,896
没道理
That makes no sense.

738
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,837
我知道你一路带着我们很不容易
I know it was hard for you to bring us along...

739
01:01:53,837 --> 01:01:57,475
但这几天是他们过得最开心的日子了
but they had the best day of their lives.

740
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,786
谢谢你
Thank you for that.

741
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,543
给你们看样东西
I want to show you something.

742
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,184
天上有数不清的太阳
More suns in the sky than you can count.

743
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,493
每颗穿过我们天空的太阳都在那里休息
Every sun that crosses our sky comes to rest up there.

744
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,405
明天
Tomorrow.

745
01:03:15,716 --> 01:03:17,640
我们在那里会很安全
That's where we'll be safe.

746
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,360
我要和盖一起去
I'm going with Guy.

747
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,360
不 不要带走我女儿
No. Not my little girl.

748
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,967
和我们一起来吧
Come with us.

749
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,750
我不能丢下古勒格
I can't go without Grug.

750
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:34,409
我不在乎 算我一个
That makes one of us. Count me in.

751
01:03:34,409 --> 01:03:36,283
真的吗？妈妈？
Really, Mom? Now?

752
01:03:36,283 --> 01:03:38,654
古勒格不知道怎么保护我们
Grug has no idea how to protect us.

753
01:03:38,654 --> 01:03:40,832
其实他没有任何点子
In fact, he has no ideas at all!

754
01:03:40,832 --> 01:03:43,686
不 不对 有一次他…呃…
No, that's not true. What about that one time when he...

755
01:03:46,579 --> 01:03:47,452
承认吧
Face it.

756
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:49,820
如果他真能想出什么点子
If he actually had an idea of his own...

757
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:53,253
我会震惊得心脏病发而死的！
I'd have a heart attack and die!

758
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,343
古勒格？
Grug?

759
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,970
- 爸爸？  - 爸爸？
- Dad! - Dad!

760
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:04,122
这么大个人哪能消失了呢？
He's a big guy. How could he just disappear like that?

761
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,995
等等 问问那个丑女人是否见到了爸爸
Hey, wait! Let's ask that ugly lady if she's seen Dad.

762
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,152
我没见到他
Haven't seen him.

763
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,032
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

764
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:17,942
我昨晚彻夜未眠 简直是灵感如泉涌
I was up all night, because all these ideas just kept coming to me.

765
01:04:17,942 --> 01:04:19,682
那是蛇吗？
Is that a snake?

766
01:04:19,682 --> 01:04:21,810
是皮带！最新改良款！
Belt, new and improved.

767
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:26,396
带自动收紧功能
It's even self-tightening!

768
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,394
你头上戴的是什么？
What is that on your head?

769
01:04:29,394 --> 01:04:31,354
是绝望
It's called desperation.

770
01:04:31,354 --> 01:04:34,088
我叫它“发壳” 跟“古勒格”押韵
I call it a "rug." Rhymes with "Grug."

771
01:04:34,088 --> 01:04:37,163
这个是…我叫它“轱辘球”
And this one, I call it a "ride."

772
01:04:37,163 --> 01:04:38,519
和“古勒格”押韵
Rhymes with "Grug."

773
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,583
一点也不押韵…
That doesn't rhyme...

774
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,639
它比鞋要快
It's going to get us places faster than shoes.

775
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,250
耶！要跟上哦！
Yeah! Try to keep up!

776
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,512
我也要轱辘球
I wish I had a ride.

777
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,269
画画已经过时了
And painting is a thing of the past.

778
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,294
我管它叫“快拍”
I call this a "snapshot."

779
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,351
再来一次 我眨眼了
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

780
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,750
我叫这个“眼罩”
I call them "shades."

781
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,132
阳光伤不到我的眼睛了
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.

782
01:05:07,132 --> 01:05:08,971
你从哪想出这些点子的？
Where do you get these great ideas?

783
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,442
因为没有脑子
Since I don't have a brain...

784
01:05:10,442 --> 01:05:13,183
它们是从我胃里反出来
they're coming from my stomach, down deep below...

785
01:05:13,183 --> 01:05:15,777
进入脑壳的
and then up again into my mind.

786
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,285
古勒格 我们得赶路啊
Grug, we have to keep moving.

787
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:23,001
看 我有点子 我有想法
See, I got ideas. I got thoughts.

788
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,503
这个 我叫它“移动的家”
Like this. I call it a "mobile home."

789
01:05:26,503 --> 01:05:28,315
牛吧？
Isn't that something?

790
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,177
这个是“抬升器”
And I'm calling this one a "lifterator."

791
01:05:34,177 --> 01:05:34,790
妈妈？
Mom?

792
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,253
我知道 要悲剧了
I know. It's bad.

793
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,511
我都快看不下去了
I almost feel sorry for him.

794
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,532
不 我还看得下去
No, I don't.

795
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,717
你这是想干什么啊 古勒格？
What are you trying to do, Grug?

796
01:05:51,717 --> 01:05:55,162
我想如果我能像盖一样
See, I thought if I could have ideas...

797
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,203
有很多点子
Iike Guy...

798
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,348
也许小伊就会听我的
maybe Eep would listen to me.

799
01:06:00,348 --> 01:06:04,089
也许她就不会想跟盖走了
And maybe she wouldn't want to go with Guy.

800
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,703
古勒格
Grug.

801
01:06:05,703 --> 01:06:08,197
就因为这点事儿？
Is that what this is all about?

802
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:15,104
我还希望这样能弄死你妈
And I also thought it would kill your mother.

803
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:17,802
所以…算是双赢吧
So win- win.

804
01:06:17,802 --> 01:06:18,942
我们到了！
We're here!

805
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,836
山洞！
Cave!

806
01:06:58,836 --> 01:06:59,859
大家都进去！
Everyone inside.

807
01:06:59,859 --> 01:07:01,184
快！快！快进去啊！
Hurry up. Let's go.

808
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,726
快进去啊！
Let's go. Go!

809
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,670
不！
No!

810
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,177
不要再住山洞了 古勒格
No more caves, Grug.

811
01:07:10,177 --> 01:07:11,213
什么？
What?

812
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:15,193
我们要跳上太阳骑着它和盖一起去明天
We're going to jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy!

813
01:07:15,193 --> 01:07:17,534
等等 你们都要走吗？
Wait. So you're all going to do this?

814
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,518
桑克？
Thunk?

815
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,973
对不起 爸爸
Sorry, Dad.

816
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,862
你不要再为我们担心了
You have to stop worrying for all of us.

817
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,689
这是我的责任 我要遵循规定
It's my job to worry! It's my job to follow the rules!

818
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,541
在这里规则不管用！
The rules don't work out here!

819
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,835
规则使我们活下来！
They kept us alive!

820
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:38,004
那不是活着 只是…没死而已
That wasn't living! That was just not dying.

821
01:07:38,004 --> 01:07:39,437
两者是有区别的
There's a difference.

822
01:07:39,437 --> 01:07:42,359
阿加 大伙 你们得听我的！
Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me.

823
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:44,660
要是听你的我们早死了！
We would be dead if we listened to you!

824
01:07:45,964 --> 01:07:48,827
我们现在听盖的
We have to follow Guy now.

825
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,847
盖？
Guy.

826
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,887
盖 快跑！
Guy? Run.

827
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,668
别这样！
This is pointless!

828
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:09,680
我们时间不多了 世界在崩塌
We're running out of time. Everything is collapsing.

829
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,761
你这是不理性 是在弄巧成拙
You're being irrational and counterproductive!

830
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,602
那些文绉绉的词儿激怒我了!
Big words anger me!

831
01:08:13,602 --> 01:08:15,005
继续说啊!
Keep talking.

832
01:08:14,983 --> 01:08:16,156
启动防御装置!
Countermeasures!

833
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,361
记得今早的你吗？你变了
You remember how you were this morning? You changed.

834
01:08:20,361 --> 01:08:22,091
成了有想法的人 现代人
Idea man. Modern man.

835
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,353
我是洞穴人！
I am a caveman!

836
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,870
不 不 不要啊！
No, no, no, wait!

837
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,270
不！
No!

838
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,350
这不让我揍你的东西是什么？
What is this stuff that saves you from my punches?

839
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,750
柏油
Tar.

840
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,190
不！我得回去找他们！
No. I have to get back to them.

841
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,030
别乱动！
Stop struggling.

842
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,100
不！
No!

843
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,220
快停下 古勒格！
Grug, stop!

844
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,550
没人能出去的
No one gets out of this.

845
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,550
相信我
Believe me...

846
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,540
我知道的
I know.

847
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,380
你的…？
Your...

848
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,230
家人 没错
Family. Yeah.

849
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,950
对不起
Sorry.

850
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,750
当时我还很小
I was little when it happened.

851
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,190
我父母对我说的最后一件事是
Last thing my parents told me was...

852
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,710
不要躲藏
"Don't hide.

853
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,070
活下去
"Live.

854
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,270
追随太阳
"Follow the sun.

855
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,550
你就能到达明天
"You'll make it to Tomorrow."

856
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,910
你追随光明
You followed the light.

857
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,710
我女儿很像你
My daughter is a lot like you.

858
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,910
不
No.

859
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,590
她像你
She's like you.

860
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,790
她很爱你 只是忘了对你说
She loves you, but always forgets to say it.

861
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,470
就像你忘了对她说一样
Just like you forget to tell her.

862
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,680
我想我只是忙着让他们活下去
I guess I was just busy keeping them all alive.

863
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,590
这没错 做爸爸的都是这样
It's okay. That's what dads do.

864
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:25,070
没错
That's right.

865
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,470
我们困在这里可成不了事
But we can't do that from here.

866
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,310
你得想个主意出来
We need one of your ideas.

867
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,990
来吧 你能行的
Come on. You can do it.

868
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,310
皮带猴 紧急点子制造机 启动！
Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, activate!

869
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,110
有了
I've got it.

870
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,220
哇
Wow.

871
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,270
我知道 但是他能做成这样已经不错了
Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best with what he has.

872
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,620
来吧
Let's go.

873
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,670
他在那儿
There he is.

874
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,148
皮带猴 来点浪漫的 戏剧的 真诚的
Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity.

875
01:11:09,148 --> 01:11:10,042
让我动起来
Move me.

876
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,235
好了 他看见我们了！
Okay, he sees us.

877
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,521
信号来了 快弄！
That's our cue. Now, work it!

878
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,574
他没过来
He's not coming over.

879
01:11:30,574 --> 01:11:32,388
我想是我们的木偶显得不够害怕
I don't think our puppet looks scared enough.

880
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:34,931
害怕？这我擅长！
Scared? I'll show you scared.

881
01:11:34,931 --> 01:11:36,862
把棍子都给我！
Hand me those acting sticks!

882
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,280
抓住！
Hold on!

883
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,455
噢耶！你成功了！
Yes! You did it.

884
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,395
- 古勒格！  - 爸爸！
- Grug! - Dad!

885
01:12:29,395 --> 01:12:30,856
嘿！我们没事儿！
Hey! We're okay!

886
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,145
是啊
Yeah.

887
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,778
我们没事儿
We're okay.

888
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,190
古勒格 你发话
Grug, your call.

889
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,558
带我们去明天吧
Take us to Tomorrow.

890
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,072
快点！
Hurry!

891
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,218
来吧！我们可以的！
Come on! We're going to make it!

892
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,747
没错！
You were right.

893
01:13:07,747 --> 01:13:10,355
就在那儿！太阳！
There it is! The sun!

894
01:13:10,355 --> 01:13:13,260
我们能行的！我们能骑着它去明天！
We can do it! We can ride it to Tomorrow!

895
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,943
快跑！
Run!

896
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,366
这是…这是为什么
I don't understand.

897
01:14:09,366 --> 01:14:12,152
太阳就在这儿 就在这儿！
The sun was right here. It was right here.

898
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,818
我们得回洞里了！
We have to go back to the cave.

899
01:14:18,818 --> 01:14:20,514
快 快 快
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

900
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,267
呆在一起！快走 走啊…走！
Stay together. Let's keep moving. Move, move, move.

901
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,234
都拉住我的手！
Everybody, hold my hand.

902
01:14:25,234 --> 01:14:28,813
桑克 快走！快 呆在一起！
Thunk, let's go. Go, go, go. Let's stay together.

903
01:14:28,813 --> 01:14:30,960
古勒格 你怎么了？
Grug. What's wrong with you?

904
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,270
古勒格 快走 不然会死的！
Grug, we'll die if we stay here!

905
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,588
古勒格 听我的
Grug, listen to me.

906
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,724
我们得回山洞里去
We've got to get back to that cave.

907
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,901
不再有黑暗
No more dark.

908
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,550
不再去躲藏
No more hiding.

909
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,146
不再住山洞了
No more caves.

910
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,447
这些都有什么意义呢？
What's the point of all this?

911
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,861
要追随光明去
To follow the light.

912
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,361
我改变不了
I can't change.

913
01:15:29,361 --> 01:15:31,363
我想不出主意
I don't have ideas.

914
01:15:31,363 --> 01:15:34,799
但是我有力气
But I have my strength.

915
01:15:34,799 --> 01:15:36,385
此刻
And right now...

916
01:15:36,385 --> 01:15:38,371
这正是你们所需要的
that's all you need.

917
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:43,255
不！我们不知道那边有什么！可能什么都没有
No, we don't know what's over there. Maybe nothing!

918
01:15:43,255 --> 01:15:45,114
这太冒险了
It's too risky!

919
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,803
这是个机会
It's a chance.

920
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,922
我来试试吧
I'll take that chance.

921
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,973
自从我第一见到你 我就想把你扔出去
I've wanted to throw you away ever since I met you.

922
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,489
你在开玩笑 是不？
That's a joke, right?

923
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,232
什么是开玩笑？
What's a "joke"?

924
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,367
他成功了！
He made it!

925
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,617
他成功了
He made it.

926
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:52,135
好了 桑克 该你了
Okay, Thunk. Your turn.

927
01:16:52,135 --> 01:16:53,868
你不一起过来吗？
You're not coming, are you?

928
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,968
你过去了我就去
When you make it, so will I.

929
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,488
不！
No!

930
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,335
你做得很好
You did good.

931
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,992
爸爸
Dadda!

932
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,399
外婆…
Gran...

933
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:35,586
别肉麻了 快扔吧
No mush. Just throw me.

934
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,776
等等！
Wait.

935
01:17:37,776 --> 01:17:39,998
你今天让我刮目相看
You surprised me today...

936
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,806
呆瓜
Iunkhead.

937
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,715
我还活着！
Still alive!

938
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,123
该走了
Time to go.

939
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,097
不！
No.

940
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,357
我有太多想说的话
I have too much to say to you.

941
01:17:55,357 --> 01:17:58,251
我需弥补一切 但来不及了
I need to fix everything, and I don't have time.

942
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,005
我能弥补
I can fix it.

943
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,254
这感觉真好
This works good.

944
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,277
你管它叫什么？
What do you call it?

945
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,487
我想叫它“拥合”
I was thinking of calling it a "hug."

946
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,350
因为和“古勒格”押韵
Because it rhymes with "Grug."

947
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,955
你要不喜欢可以改
But you can change it if you want.

948
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,591
不 我喜欢“拥合”
No. I like "hug."

949
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,965
我爱你
I love you.

950
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:35,631
我…
I...

951
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,114
爸爸
Dad...

952
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,042
我害怕
I'm scared.

953
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,698
不要害怕
Never be afraid.

954
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,487
那儿！
There!

955
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:27,906
我看见他了
I see him!

956
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,839
嘿！
Hey!

957
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,280
我成功了
Hey, I did it!

958
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,207
别过来！
Back! Stay back!

959
01:21:39,207 --> 01:21:40,125
别过来！
Stay back!

960
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,968
他们危险了
They're in trouble.

961
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,963
坚持住！我来了！
Hang on, I'm coming!

962
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,764
我该怎么过去呢？
How do I get across?

963
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,638
我得想想 盖会怎么做？
I have to think. What would Guy do?

964
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,443
盖会怎么做？盖会怎么做？
What would Guy do, what would Guy do?

965
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,861
我会怎么做？
What would I do?

966
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,121
拿着
Hold this.

967
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,820
我想到了…
I have...

968
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:07,626
一个好主意！
an idea!

969
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,978
快跑！
Run!

970
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,216
太好了
Yes!

971
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,971
道格拉斯！
Douglas?

972
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,865
我认识他！
Hey, I know that guy.

973
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,600
坚持住！
Hold on!

974
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,376
这里不安全
It's not safe here.

975
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,979
我去告诉她
I'll tell her.

976
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,120
我都没来得及告诉他
I never got to tell him.

977
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:43,604
小伊 如果你爸爸在这儿的话 他会和你说…
Eep, if your dad were here, he would tell you to...

978
01:26:43,604 --> 01:26:46,480
闪开！
Get out of the way!

979
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,133

他成功了！
He did it!

983
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,372
他骑着太阳
He's riding the sun.

984
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,745
但骑得不太好
But, not very well.

985
01:27:00,745 --> 01:27:02,123
大家闪开！
Everybody out of the way!

986
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,276
- 爸爸  - 古勒格！

987
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,441
危险在哪儿？谁吹的号角？
Where's the danger? Who blew their shell?

988
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,870
我也爱你！
I love you, too!

989

996
01:27:42,652 --> 01:27:45,076
道格拉斯！爸爸 你救了他！
Douglas! Dad, you saved him!

997
01:27:45,076 --> 01:27:47,212
男孩应该有个宠物
A boy has to have a pet.

998
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,858
没想到我和猫处得不错
Turns out I'm a cat person.

999
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,677
不行！
No.

1000
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:09,670
你们快来看
You really need to see this.

1001
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,337
我们应该去那里
We should go there.

1002
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,147
耶！我来啦！
Yes! Coming through!

1003
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,050
等等
Wait!

1004
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:37,878
这就是我 小伊
This is me. My name is Eep.

1005
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:41,316
这是我的家人 克鲁家族
And this is my family, the Croods.

1006
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,934
你应该能从晒黑的皮肤和宠物
If you weren't clued in by the suntans and pets...

1007
01:28:43,934 --> 01:28:46,561
判断出我们不再是穴居人了
we're not exactly cavemen anymore.

1008
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,217
再来一次 我眨眼了
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

1009
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,046
我们的世界依旧充满了危险与困难
Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile...

1010
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,841
但现在我们知道克鲁家族能应付得了
but now we know the Croods will make it.

1011
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,700
因为我们改变了规矩
Because we changed the rules...

1012
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,096
不再遵循把我们囚在黑暗里的规定
the ones that kept us in the dark.

1013
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:12,163
也因为我爸爸 他教会了我们人皆可变
And because of my dad, who taught us that anyone can change.

1014
01:29:12,163 --> 01:29:14,246
放孩子！
Release the baby!

1015
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,039
算是吧
Sort of.

1016
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,758
所以 从现在开始 我们住在这里
So, from now on,we'll stay out here...

1017
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,550
这个能追随光明的地方
where we can follow the light.

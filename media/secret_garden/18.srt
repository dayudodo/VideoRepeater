CHAPTER EIGHTEEN COMING ALIVE

2
00:00:04,573 --> 00:00:11,068
Now that the sun had gone down, it was time for Mary and Colin to go back to the house.

3
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:15,282
They were both very hungry, and couldn't wait to eat.

4
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,918
They said goodbye to Ben Weatherstaff.

5
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:22,572
"Make sure to come here tomorrow," said Colin to Ben.

6
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:28,554
While Dickon was pushing Colin's chair back to the house, Colin had an idea.

7
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:33,999
"Mary and Dickon," he said, "I am going to get well.

8
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:39,962
I'm going to walk and run, and be just like any other boy.

9
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:43,200
When my father returns, I will say to him.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,515
'Here I am, father. I am well and I will live to be a man.'

11
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:53,278
But I don't want the servants whispering and asking questions.

12
00:00:53,278 --> 00:01:00,536
I will go to the garden every day and practice walking and running until I can do both.

13
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:05,380
But I will go there in my chiar, and come back in my chair.

14
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:11,731
No one will know I'm well, until I walk back to the house and show them."

15
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:14,696
Dickon and Mary were very impressed.

16
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:18,857
It would be fun, to keep this secret from the adults.

17
00:01:18,857 --> 00:01:23,973
When Colin was in his room again, his doctor came to see him.

18
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:29,702
"You should not have stayed outside so long," he said seriously.

19
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:33,314
"You will become tried and ill again."

20
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:39,367
"No, I won't. I'm not tired at all," said Colin.

21
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:43,642
"I will go to the garden every day from now on."

22
00:01:43,642 --> 00:01:46,612
"I don't think I can allow that.

23
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:51,103
It would not be safe for you," said the doctor.

24
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:56,575
"You shouldn't try to stop me. I will go," said Colin.

25
00:01:56,575 --> 00:02:00,842
He wasn't angry, but he looked very serious.

26
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:05,329
After the doctor had gone Mary looked at Colin thoughtfully.

27
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:10,703
He probably didn't know how rude he was, always telling people what to do.

28
00:02:10,703 --> 00:02:13,970
Mary had once been like that, In India.

29
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,911
She had always ordered the servants, and never said "please" or "thank you" to anyone.

30
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:25,867
However, she had discovered that this behavior was not normal, or nice.

31
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:30,642
"I feel sorry for the doctor," she said to Colin.

32
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:34,003
"Why?" Colin asked.

33
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:38,519
"Well, that doctor's taken care of you for ten years,

34
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,293
and you're so terribly rude to him.

35
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:44,758
I never would have done it," Mary said.

36
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:51,695
"Am I rude?" Colin asked calmly. He'd never thought of it before.

37
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:54,779
"Very," said Mary.

38
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:57,888
"Everyone thought they had to do what you wanted,

39
00:02:57,888 --> 00:03:00,378
because they thought you were going to die.

40
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:05,288
Everyone felt sorry for you, but they also didn't like you.

41
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:08,099
You were awful to be with."

42
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,984
"I don't want people to feel sorry  for me," said Colin.

43
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:17,621
"I won't let people feel sorry for me.

44
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,753
I stood up and walked this afternoon."

45
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:29,368
"It's always having your own way,that's made you so rude and strange," said Mary honestly.

46
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:36,117
Colin looked a little upset. "But don't worry," she continued.

47
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:41,197
"I'm very strange, too. So is Ben Weatherstaff.

48
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:45,086
I was much stranger before I began to like people,

49
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:47,515
and before I found the garden."

50
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:56,091
Colin looked serious. "I don't want to be poor, or strange," he said.

51
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:58,748
"I'm not going to be."

52
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:04,179
Soon he began to smile. "I'll stop being strange,

53
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:09,057
if I go to the garden every day," he said.

54
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:13,286
"There's magic there, Mary. I know it!

55
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,874
It will make me well."

56
00:04:15,874 --> 00:04:21,337
And in the next few months, it seemed that there really  was magic in the garden.

57
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:26,186
Every day, Colin was in the garden with Mary and Dickon.

58
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:31,093
Often Ben Weatherstaff would come and help them care for their plants.

59
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:34,841
The amazing things that happened in that garden!

60
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,848
It seemed that the flowers would never stop growing.

61
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:43,948
There were so many kinds of flowers, you could hardly count them all.

62
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:49,949
And the roses! They grew until there were a thousand of them in the garden.

63
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,679
There were mountains of roses.

64
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:59,211
They grew around the tree trunks, over the stone benches, and everywhere.

65
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:02,267
The air was filled with their scent.

66
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:07,744
Ben Weatherstaff planted many special flowers that Colin's mother had loved.

67
00:05:07,744 --> 00:05:11,381
"She always liked these, Master Colin,"

68
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:15,854
he said one day, pointing to some tall purple flowers.

69
00:05:15,854 --> 00:05:21,189
"Your mother liked flowers that always looked up at the sun and sky.

70
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:25,993
She herself wasn't a lady who looked down at the ground.

71
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:32,334
Not her! She said the blue sky always looked so happy."

72
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:35,569
Colin kept his promise to himself.

73
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,943
Every day he took a walk around the garden.

74
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:43,758
He was very slow at first, and he got tired easily.

75
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:45,812
But he did not give up.

76
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:50,431
He believed that there was some kind of magic in the garden.

77
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:54,225
It gave his arms and legs strength to move.

78
00:05:54,225 --> 00:06:00,713
Of course, Colin wanted to walk and run, so he tried very hard.

79
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:04,669
But who was to say there wasn't some magic there?

80
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:08,602
Colin grew very interested in the ways of nature.

81
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:14,406
He would lie on the grass for hours, watching the insects and birds.

82
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:19,596
He was certain that there was some magic in them that made them grow.

83
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:27,230
Sometimes, he would talk to Mary, Ben Weatherstaff, and Dickon about magic.

84
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:33,667
"When I grow up, I am going to be a scientist," Colin would say.

85
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:37,974
"I will learn about the magic that is in the earth.

86
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:41,158
It is the same magic that is in me.

87
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:45,159
It's the magic that made me want to walk."

88
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:49,978
The secret garden was not the only garden Dickon worked in.

89
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:55,749
Often, when Mary and Colin didn't see him, he was busy working in his family's garden.

90
00:06:55,749 --> 00:07:01,479
They grew cabbages, potatoes, carrots, and herbs.

91
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,586
Dickon's mother always said that their vegetables tasted better than anyone else's.

92
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:12,064
One evening is early summer Dickon was working in his garden.

93
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:17,640
He was telling his mother, Mrs. Sowerby, all about Colin and Mary.

94
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,981
How they had changed! Mary had become a very pretty girl.

95
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:26,133
She now looked like her mother once had.

96
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:29,380
Colin was looking so much healthier.

97
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,882
His face was fuller, and his skin was a healthy pink instead of pale white.

98
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:39,520
He was always hungry from his daily exercise in the garden.

99
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:47,196
"Of course, Master Colin told us he doesn't want anyone to know," Dickon told his mother.

100
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:53,934
"If his doctor knew how well Master Colin was doing, he'd write Master Craven.

101
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:57,972
Colin wants to surprise his father when he comes home.

102
00:07:57,972 --> 00:08:04,608
But it's hard! Master Colin has to pretend to be sick and weak,

103
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:10,048
When he's not. He and Mary have a good time acting!

104
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:16,273
But they're always so hungry, and they can't send any food away.

105
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:19,726
He and Mary have to eat it all.

106
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:24,230
The doctor and Mrs. Medlock, they don't know what to think."

107
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,360
Mrs. Sowerby laughed at this funny situation.

108
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,774
"Listen, Dickon. Tomorrow morning, when you go there,

109
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:36,194
I'll send some fresh bread and milk with you.

110
00:08:36,194 --> 00:08:42,940
I'll do it as often as I can. Then they won't be so hungry in the evenings,"

111
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,618
she said. "They're just two growing children.

112
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:51,600
They're hungry as little wolves, poor things!"

113
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,262
"You always think of a good idea, Mother," said Dickon.

114
00:08:57,262 --> 00:09:00,634
Mary and Colin were very grateful the next day,

115
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:06,110
when Dickon brought them a bucket of fresh milk, and a basket of warm bread.

116
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:12,397
"Tell your mother she is a magic person, like you are!" said Colin.

117
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:19,391
The food that Mary and Colin received from Mrs. Sowerby helped their "play acting" greatly.

118
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:22,592
It was easy to eat little in the evenings,

119
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:26,110
when they were filled with fresh bread and creaw and milk.

120
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,255
They could easily pretend to be sickely chidlren who had no appetite.

121
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:35,419
Sometimes, Colin would pretend he had a fever.

122
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:40,261
"I don't understand at all!" Mrs. Medlock said to the doctor.

123
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:45,051
"Those terrible children are getting fatter and healthier looking every day.

124
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:49,145
First, they are like wolves. Now, they won't eat anything!

125
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:52,259
They just send food right back to the kitchen.

126
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,810
How is it possible?" The doctor immediately went to examine Colin.

127
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,348
"You are looking much better," he said to Colin.

128
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:05,495
"I'm sorry you are not eating.

129
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:10,827
You will become thing and weak again, if you don't eat."

130
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:16,461
"I told you- it was not a natural hunger," said Colin.

131
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:19,266
He tried not to laugh.

132
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:25,431
"I must write your father and tell him about this," said the doctor.

133
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:33,148
"No!" cried Colin. "I won't be written about, and talked about!

134
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:36,846
I am probably going to be sick again.

135
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:41,728
It will only disappoint him. I feel sick now.

136
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:48,503
I think I have a fever. You are making me angry,

137
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:54,191
and you know that is bad for me! I hate being written about,

138
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:57,073
as much as I hate being looked at!"

139
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:06,167
"Quiet, my boy. No letter will be sent,without your permission,"said the doctor.

140
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:10,662
He said no more about it, and soon left the room.

141
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:15,414
When he did, Colin and Mary burst out laughing.

142
00:11:15,414 --> 00:11:21,001
"I don't understand it either, Sarah," said the doctor to Mrs. Medlock.

143
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:26,240
"Is there any way the children can get food secretly?"

144
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,469
"Not unless they dig it out of the ground!" said Mrs. Medlock.

145
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:34,363
"Really, the change is amazing.

146
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:38,760
Miss Mary sued to be the uglisest, thinnest little girl.

147
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,681
She looked like a sour old woman! Now she's pretty.

148
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:47,942
Now, she and Master Colin are always outside.

149
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:51,922
The laugh together just like normal children.

150
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:55,027
Maybe they're getting fat on that."

151
00:11:55,027 --> 00:12:00,486
"Maybe they are," said the doctor. "Let them laugh!"

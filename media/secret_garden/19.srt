CHAPTER NINETEEN IN THE GARDEN

2
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:06,370
The summer went on.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,717
Every day the people in the secret garden became happier and healthier.

4
00:00:11,717 --> 00:00:15,497
The secret garden grew more beautiful every day.

5
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:20,927
But far away from England, there was one person who was not happy.

6
00:00:20,927 --> 00:00:24,207
This man, Archibald Craven,

7
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:30,091
had left Misselthwaite Manor when the air was still cold and the sky gray.

8
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:37,083
He had traveled to Europe to see the mountains of Switzerland, and the fields of Norway.

9
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:43,881
He saw places of such beauty that any man would feel happy - but not him.

10
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:50,117
For ten years now, he had been holding a terrible sadness in his heart.

11
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:56,046
He had never tried to replace any of the terrible, dark thoughts with better ones.

12
00:00:56,046 --> 00:01:00,123
He told himself life would never get any better.

13
00:01:00,123 --> 00:01:06,907
However, one day he was wandering in a beautiful field in the mountian of Austria.

14
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:11,339
The snow covered mountains sparkled like diamonds.

15
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:16,875
He sighed, and lay down in the grass by a little stream.

16
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:21,984
As he lay there, a very strange thing began to happen.

17
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:25,931
The whole valley was still and quiet.

18
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:29,423
The clear blue sky looked like Heaven.

19
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:33,227
There were little birds singing in the trees.

20
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:41,208
As Archilbald Craven lay there, he felt his whole soul and body becoming still and quiet too.

21
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:46,559
He felt peaceful, for the first time in many years.

22
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:50,363
He looked at some little blue flowers in the grass.

23
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:54,354
He thought to himself that they were pretty little flowers.

24
00:01:54,354 --> 00:02:00,959
He hadn't thought of flowers, and trees, and nature for many years.

25
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,976
It was too painful, and reminded him of his dead wife.

26
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:11,078
But today, he found himself enjoying nature.

27
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:15,367
He felt so peaceful that he soon fell asleep.

28
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:22,250
He slept deeply and calmly. Soon he began to dream.

29
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,250
He dreamed that he was surrounded by roses.

30
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,886
He didn't know where he was.

31
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:36,724
Then he heard a sweet, clear voice call, "Archie! Archie! Archie!"

32
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:44,764
It was the voice of his wife. "Lilias! Lilias!" he cried, jumping up.

33
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,168
"Where are you?"

34
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:53,273
"In the garden," said the voice, laughing. "I'm in the garden!"

35
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:59,258
Archibald Craven woke up immediately. What had happened?

36
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:02,054
He sat looking at the little stream.

37
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:09,404
The dream had seemed so real. "In the garden!" he said aloud.

38
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:14,890
"But the garden is locked, and the key was thrown away."

39
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,190
He walked the many miles back to his hotel.

40
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,981
The hotel was on the edge lf a deep, clear lake.

41
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:26,417
By the time he reached his room it was night.

42
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:31,015
The bright yellow moon shone among a million stars.

43
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:35,168
He was surprised to see that a letter was waiting for him.

44
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:41,479
It had come from Yorkshine! He did not recognize the handwriting. It read:

45
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,309
Dear Sir,

46
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:50,124
I am Susan Sowerby whose daughter, Martha, works at Misselthwaite Manor.

47
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:55,526
Once I spoke to you about Miss Mary. Now, I will speak again.

48
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,874
Please,sir, I would come home, if I were you.

49
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:05,044
I think you would be happy to come and, if you will excuse me,sir,

50
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:09,191
I think your lady would ask you to come, if she were here.

51
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:13,027
Yours, Susan Sowerby

52
00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:17,047
Archibald Craven kept thinking about his dream.

53
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:19,807
He put the letter in his pocket.

54
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:24,927
"I'll return to Misselthwaite immediately," he said.

55
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:28,820
In a few days he was in Yorkshine again.

56
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,335
he was taking the train across the country.

57
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:38,151
During this time, he found himself thinking of his son, Colin.

58
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:41,068
He tried never to think about thim.

59
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:44,855
When he was born, his mother had died.

60
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:51,226
For many months Archiblad had been almost insance with anger and sadness.

61
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:56,630
The child was thin and small, and everyone said he would die.

62
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,968
Archibald hadn't wanted to see him at all.

63
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:02,490
But the child didn't die.

64
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:08,342
Instead he grew into a sickly, miserable child with a terrible temper.

65
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:11,861
Thinking about Colin was unpleasant.

66
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:16,243
But for the first time,his father thought to himself,

67
00:05:16,243 --> 00:05:20,443
 "Perhaps it is not too late to do something.

68
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:25,575
Perhaps I can help him. What have I been thinking of?"

69
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:30,965
When he reacched Misselthwate Manor, he felt something had changed about it.

70
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:34,597
The dark house didn't look so dead.

71
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:40,475
The late summer sunlight made the trees and gardens glow.

72
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:43,742
Everything looked magical, somehow.

73
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:48,883
Strangely, Archibald Craven felt glad to be home.

74
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:52,191
He walked around the gardens for a while.

75
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:57,060
He felt, somehow, afraid to pass by the secret garden.

76
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,948
But he had a strange desire to find the door.

77
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:05,655
"I will try to find the key and open the door.

78
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:11,206
I don't know why. The garden has been dead for many years."

79
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:14,526
He approached the wall of the secret garden.

80
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:18,011
It was covered with vines, as always.

81
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:22,670
On the outside, everything looked the same as it had.

82
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:28,809
But if the garden was dead, then what were the sounds he heard inside its walls?

83
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:33,345
Laughter, and sounds like feet running!

84
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:40,111
"Am I in a dream?" Archibald wondered. "Have I lost my mind?

85
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:42,767
I must be hearing things!"

86
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:49,545
Suddenly the door to the garden flew open. A boy ran out.

87
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:55,047
He didn't see Archibald standing there, and almost ran into him.

88
00:06:55,047 --> 00:07:00,617
Archibald held his hands out just in time to prevent the boy from falling.

89
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:05,856
When he looked into the boy's face, his heart began to pound.

90
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:08,883
The boy was tall and handsome.

91
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:13,133
His large gray eyes were shing with life.

92
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:17,275
The running had given his face a healthy color.

93
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:21,671
The boy brushed his thick, dark hair away from his face,

94
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:24,909
and stared at the man with laughing eyes.

95
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:29,871
It was the boy's eyes that made Archibald grasp for breath.

96
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:32,543
They were his mother's eyes.

97
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:38,201
"Who- what! Who?" Archibald said.

98
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:42,686
Now, this was not what Colin had expected, or planned.

99
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:45,602
But he straightened up and said,

100
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:50,914
"Father, I'm Colin. You may not belive it.

101
00:07:50,914 --> 00:07:55,907
I can't believe it myself, But I'm Colin."

102
00:07:55,907 --> 00:08:00,980
Archibald Craven felt a great joy grow inside of him.

103
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,870
He still could not speak.

104
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:10,978
"I'm well now. The garden, and Mary, and Dickon made me well.

105
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:15,596
We kept the secret, to tell you when you came back.

106
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,310
I can beat Mary in a race!

107
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,886
I'm going to be an athelete."

108
00:08:20,886 --> 00:08:25,001
Archibald Craven's soul was filled with joy.

109
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:28,165
He put his hands on the boy's shoulders.

110
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:30,951
This was the meaning of the dream.

111
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:36,653
It was time for him to begin living again, as his son had.

112
00:08:36,653 --> 00:08:43,822
"Take me into the garden, my boy," he said, "and tell me all about it."

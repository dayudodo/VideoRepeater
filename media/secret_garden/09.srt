CHAPTER NINE BEHIND THE GARDEN WALLS

2
00:00:05,103 --> 00:00:10,988
Mary couldn't imagine a more wonderful place than the secret garden.

3
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:15,504
It seemed that the garden's owner had loved roses,

4
00:00:15,504 --> 00:00:19,984
for the garden was filled with many rose bushes and rose vines.

5
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:24,619
They looked brown, dry, and dead, however.

6
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:31,446
So did the grass. The rose vines dropped onto the trees like curtains.

7
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:38,510
"If this garden were green, how many roses there would be!" thought Mary.

8
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,320
"How still and quiet it is here!"

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,574
The robin was sitting on a tree in the garden.

10
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:49,502
He didn't sing anymore; he only looked at Mary,

11
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:52,128
as if too see what she would do next.

12
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:57,150
"Of course it's quiet," whipsered Mary to herself.

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,134
"I'm the only person who's been in here for ten years."

14
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:05,011
She began to explore the garden.

15
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:09,290
"I wonder if all these trees and plants are really dead."

16
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:15,228
she thougtht. "Is this a dead garden? Oh, I wish it wasn't!

17
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:20,086
Just think how many roses there would be, if this garden were alive!"

18
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:24,574
If Mary had been a gardener, like Ben Weatherstaff,

19
00:01:24,574 --> 00:01:29,148
she would have been able to tell whether a plant was dead or not.

20
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:36,908
But she wasn't -- all she saw were many brown and gray trees, vines, and bushes.

21
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:43,118
They certainly looked dead. But suddenly Mary gave a little cry.

22
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,660
In one corner of the garden there was a patch of black dirt.

23
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,486
In the dirt were tiny green plants!

24
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,394
Mary remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said.

25
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:58,278
She bent down to look at them.

26
00:01:58,278 --> 00:02:02,322
"Yes, they're tiny green growing things.

27
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:06,058
They might be little flowers, like Ben said.

28
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:09,620
So it isn't a completely dead garden.

29
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,932
Even if the poor roses are dead, there are other things that are alive!"

30
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:18,980
she said softly. She felt extremely happy.

31
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,239
She went around the garden to see if there were more tiny green plants.

32
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:26,052
Happily, they were everywhere.

33
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:30,666
It seemed to Mary that the little plants didn't have room to grow,

34
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,901
because of the dead grass all around them.

35
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:37,211
The grass seemed to be choking the plants.

36
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:41,052
She found a sharp stick and dug up the dead grass,

37
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:45,228
until there were clear spaces around a few of the plants.

38
00:02:45,228 --> 00:02:50,720
"There, now you have some room to breathe in," she said.

39
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,543
"I'm going to help as many of these plants as I can today.

40
00:02:54,543 --> 00:03:00,121
Then I'll come back tomorrow and the next day and do more," she said.

41
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:03,107
She was very happy with this idea.

42
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:06,228
Mary went from place to place.

43
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:10,599
She removed dead grass and weeds from around the little green plants.

44
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:16,955
How happy she was! She soon became very warm, and took off her coat.

45
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:21,156
She breathed in the smell of the fresh black soil.

46
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:25,060
She didn't realize that she was smiling as she worked.

47
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,831
The little plants looked so much better when they didn't have all that dead grass around them!

48
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:34,679
The robin was watching Mary with great interest.

49
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:39,410
He was very pleased to see someone working in his garden at last!

50
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,508
Mary worked in the garden until it was time for lunch.

51
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:47,964
She had worked for three hours, but the time had passed quickly.

52
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:51,793
"I'll return right after lunch," she said.

53
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:55,960
She spoke to the trees and bushes, as if they might hear her.

54
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,248
Quickly and quietly she opened the old door, and then closed it.

55
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:04,673
She made sure to hide the door behind the vines.

56
00:04:04,673 --> 00:04:07,346
Then she returned to the house.

57
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:12,924
At lunch Mary ate two plates of food, she was so hungry.

58
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:19,525
Martha was happy. "Won't mother be pleased when she finds out!" she said.

59
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:26,152
"Martha," said Mary, "do you know anything about growing flowers?"

60
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:31,090
"Not much," said Martha. "But Dickon does,

61
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,625
Oh! He's got so many flowers planted in his garden.

62
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:39,092
He can make a flower grow out of a brick wall.

63
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:43,160
Mother says he just whispers to things, and they grow."

64
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,561
"Do roots under the ground live a long time?

65
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:53,200
 I mean, would they live years and years, ever if no one helped them?" asked Mary.

66
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,400
"Some do. Those flowers that have special roots, called bulbs,

67
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,829
can live a long time with no help.

68
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:04,109
That's why poor people like us can grow them!

69
00:05:04,109 --> 00:05:10,239
Dickon has lots of bulb flowers in his garden, like daffodils and snowdrops."

70
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:16,031
Mary was finished with her lunch. She went and sat by the fire.

71
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:21,327
"I wish I had some little garden tools," she said slowly.

72
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:25,971
"What do you want those for?" asked Martha, smiling.

73
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:31,068
Mary thought carefully. The hidden garden must remain a secret.

74
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:35,250
If she told anyone, Mr. Craven might find out.

75
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,282
Then he would be terribly angry,

76
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:42,014
and get a new key made and lock the garden up forever.

77
00:05:42,014 --> 00:05:46,235
"Well, this is such a big lonely house.

78
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:51,657
I have no one to play with, and you and Ben Weatherstaff have to do your work.

79
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:56,312
If I had some little garden tools, I could make a garden,

80
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:58,897
if Ben would give me some seeds."

81
00:05:58,897 --> 00:06:03,259
Martha said, "Well, I'm amazed!

82
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:05,604
Mother said the same thing to me.

83
00:06:05,604 --> 00:06:09,027
She said, 'There's so much land in that place.

84
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:11,957
Why don't they give her a little land for herself?

85
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:16,419
Even if she doesn't plant anything but herbs, she'd enjoy herself!

86
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,820
Those were the words she said."

87
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,632
"You mother knows a lot of things, doesn't she?" asked Mary.

88
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:28,865
"Oh, yes!" said Martha. "Mother says,

89
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:33,701
'A woman who brings up twelve children learns something besides her letters!"

90
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:38,437
"How much would some garden tools cost?" asked Mary.

91
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:41,975
"There's a little shop in the village that sells them.

92
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:48,399
There's a set of tools that has a little rake, a fork, and a spade all tied together.

93
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,963
The set costs only a few coins, I think.

94
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:54,089
Now I have an idea!

95
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:58,237
The shop also sells bags of flower seeds for a penny each.

96
00:06:58,237 --> 00:07:04,375
Our Dickon knows which flowers to plant and how to make them grow, like I told  you.

97
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,644
Do you know how to write?" she asked.

98
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:13,498
"Of course!" said Mary. "If you can write, we could send a letter to him.

99
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:18,832
I could ask him to go and buy you some seeds and garden tools."

100
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:23,500
"Oh, you're a nice girl!" cried Mary.

101
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,344
"You really are. You tell me what to write, and I'll write it."

102
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:34,584
"I'll go and get a pen and paper!" said Martha, and left the room.

103
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:37,554
Mary waited anxiously.

104
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:42,680
"If I have some seeds and tools," she whispered to herself,

105
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,478
"I can try to make the secret garden beautiful again!"

106
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,666
It was a long time before Martha came back,

107
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,960
because she had duties to do for Mrs. Medlock.

108
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,964
When she returned they sat down and worked on the letter.

109
00:07:56,964 --> 00:08:03,030
Martha told Mary what she wanted to say, and Mary wrote it. Here is the letter.

110
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,201
My dear Dickon,

111
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:12,151
I hope you are well, as I am. Will you take this money(it is Miss Mary's)

112
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:15,678
and go and buy her some seeds and garden tools?

113
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:19,157
Pick the seeds that are the easiest to grow,

114
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:21,488
but still make pretty flowers.

115
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:27,890
Miss Mary has never gardened before because she has lived in India, which is different.

116
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,962
Give Mother and the others my love.

117
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:35,395
Miss Mary says she will tell me more stories of India,

118
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:40,028
so that when I next return home you can hear about elephants,

119
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:43,952
camels, and gentlemen hunting lions and tigers.

120
00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:46,001
Your loving sister,

121
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:48,247
Martha Phoebe Sowerby

122
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:54,503
"Now, we'll put the money in the envelope, and I'll tell the farm boy to take it to Dickon.

123
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:58,405
Dickon will bring the things to you himself," said Martha.

124
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:04,030
"Oh! I never thought I would meet Dickon," said Mary.

125
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,987
"I never saw a boy who animals loved."

126
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:09,369
Martha thought for a minute.

127
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:12,489
"Do you know, I forgot to tell you something?

128
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:17,976
Mother said she'd ask Mrs. Medlock if you could come and visit our cottage some day."

129
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:26,715
"Really?" cried Mary. She wanted nothing more than to visit the house, which sounded so warm and happy.

130
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:31,709
It seemed as if all good and interesting things were happening that day.

131
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:36,320
"If I went to your house I would meet your mother as well as Dickon.

132
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,302
And your brothers and sisters!

133
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:43,091
I would see the moor and the blue sky," said Mary.

134
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:48,981
She was beginning to feel sleepy, because of the excitement of the day.

135
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:54,845
She and Martha sat comfortably together in front of the fire until Mary was asleep.

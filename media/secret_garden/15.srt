CHAPTER FIFTEEN TROUBLE IN THE NIGHT

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:09,477
Mary had been up very early that morning, so she went to sleep early.

3
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:14,497
However, she was wakened in the night by horrible sounds.

4
00:00:14,498 --> 00:00:18,125
She jumped out of bed. What was it?

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,987
The next second she knew. It was Colin.

6
00:00:21,987 --> 00:00:26,306
Doors were opening, and people were running up and down the halls.

7
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:29,871
He was screaming and crying in a horrible way.

8
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:33,868
It sounded like he was dying, or going crazy.

9
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:37,508
"It's got to stop!" said Mary.

10
00:00:37,508 --> 00:00:40,351
She put her hands over her ears.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,478
"It has no! How awful it sounds."

12
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:48,910
Mary understood why everyone gave Colin what he wanted.

13
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,168
They didn't want to hear him.

14
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:53,873
The terrible sounds frightened her,

15
00:00:53,873 --> 00:00:59,597
but they also made her angry. How dare Colin act this way!

16
00:00:59,597 --> 00:01:01,709
"He should be stopped!

17
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:05,805
Someone ought to beat him until he stops!" she cried.

18
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:10,654
Suddenly the door opened and Colin's nurse ran into the room.

19
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:14,681
"Can you make him stop, Miss Mary?" she cried.

20
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:17,975
"He'll hurt himself, screaming and crying this way.

21
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:21,263
He'll make himself sick. He likes you.

22
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:24,562
Please come and try, like a good girl."

23
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:26,967
Mary didn't waste any time.

24
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:29,551
She ran down the hall to Colin's room.

25
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:33,893
The louder the screams got, the angrier Mary became.

26
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:39,110
By the time she threw open Colin's door, she was ready for a fight!

27
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,574
She ran over to his bed.

28
00:01:41,574 --> 00:01:48,385
"Stop it!" she shouted. "Stop it right now! I hate you!

29
00:01:48,385 --> 00:01:50,281
Everyone hates you!

30
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:55,094
Everyone should leave this house and let you scream until you die!

31
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:56,909
I wish you would!"

32
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,850
Now, a nice, ordinary child would never have said these things.

33
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,689
But Mary was not a nice, ordinary girl.

34
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:11,813
Fortunately, the shock of hearing someone shouting at him was enough to make Colin stop.

35
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:17,590
His face looked terrible, it was white and red. But Mary did not care.

36
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,135
"If you scream one more time, I'll scream too.

37
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:27,291
I can scream louder than you can, and I'll frighten you!" she said.

38
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:31,351
"I can't stop! I can't!" he cried.

39
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:37,503
"You can!" shouted Mary. "The only thing wrong with you is your temper.

40
00:02:37,503 --> 00:02:41,257
You're not sick! Just be quiet!"

41
00:02:41,257 --> 00:02:45,057
"I felt the lump in my back!" cried Colin.

42
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:51,117
"I knew it would come. I'm going to be a hunchback and then I'll die!"

43
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:55,065
"You did not feel a lump!" said Mary.

44
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:57,711
"That's only your imagination.

45
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,641
There's nothing wrong with your horrible back.

46
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:03,857
You let me look at it. Nurse!

47
00:03:03,857 --> 00:03:07,363
Come here and show me this back this minute!"

48
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:12,524
The nurse, Mrs. Medlock ,and Martha had been listening outside.

49
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:16,479
The nurse entered. She was very afraid.

50
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,363
"I don't think he'll let me!" she said.

51
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:25,145
"Show her! She'll see then!" cried Colin.

52
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:29,578
The nurse turned Colin over, and Mary looked at his back.

53
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:33,981
It was a very thin back.  You could see all the bones.

54
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,970
But there wasn't anything wrong with it.

55
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,614
"Ha! There's no lump on your silly back.

56
00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:44,489
It's just thin, so you can feel your bones.

57
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,126
My back used to look like that, until I became fatter.

58
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:51,390
If you say there is a lump again,

59
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,446
I'll laugh at you!"

60
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:57,889
Truthfully, this was the best thing for Colin to hear.

61
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,611
He hadn't told anyone about his fears.

62
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:04,076
But if he had talked to his doctor or his nurses,

63
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:09,573
he would have discovered that most of his illnesses and fears were created by himself.

64
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:14,434
Now, an angry little girl from India was telling him that his fears were silly.

65
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:16,446
He hoped she was right.

66
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:20,537
"I didn't know the boy thought he had a lump on his back.

67
00:04:20,537 --> 00:04:24,823
I could have told him it was fine," said the nurse.

68
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:28,824
"I'ts just weak, because he won't exercise it."

69
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:33,900
"Do you...think I'll live to grow up?" asked Colin.

70
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,679
"Yes, if you take care of yourself and get plenty of fresh air.

71
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:42,947
You must watch your temper, too," said the nurse.

72
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:48,284
Tears ran down Colin's face, but they were tears of relief.

73
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:52,202
Seeing this, Mary's anger went away.

74
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:55,567
Colin put out his hand and she touched it.

75
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:58,411
It was a sort of apology.

76
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:01,763
"I'll go outside with you, Mary.

77
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:07,308
I would like to see Dickon and his animal," said Colin.

78
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,828
He remembered not to mention the secret garden.

79
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:14,825
After everyone else had left Mary said to Colin,

80
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:17,783
"Do you want me to sing you that Indian song?"

81
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:24,254
"Thank you, Mary. That would be nice," said Colin softly.

82
00:05:24,254 --> 00:05:29,258
"Before, you said you had nice things to tell me.

83
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:34,327
Do you think you have found a way into the secret garden?"

84
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:39,818
Mary looked at Colin's poor tired face and she decided to tell him.

85
00:05:39,818 --> 00:05:43,070
"Yes, I think I have.

86
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:48,979
If you will go to sleep I'll tell you all about it tomorrow," she said.

87
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:51,939
"Oh, Mary!" whispered Colin.

88
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:54,916
"If I could go into the secret garden,

89
00:05:54,916 --> 00:06:00,432
I think I would live to grow up. I would be so much better."

90
00:06:00,432 --> 00:06:05,611
Then she sang to him a little, and soon Colin was asleep.

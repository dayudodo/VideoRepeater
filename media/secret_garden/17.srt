CHAPTER SEVENTEEN BEN WEATHERSTAFF

2
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:09,101
Mary had never seen such a beautiful afternoon.

3
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:15,714
Even Dickon, who lived every day outside, shook his head and said,

4
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:22,805
"Well, I've seen a lot of pretty days, but never one as nice as this."

5
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:26,218
They pushed Colin's chair under a tree.

6
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:30,024
Colin could not stop staring at everything.

7
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:33,093
Mary and Dickon brought him things to look at,

8
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:40,419
small flowers, bird feathers, and an egg shell from a bird that had just been born.

9
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:45,143
The cherry and apple trees had white and pink flowers.

10
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:49,307
In summer there would be delicious fruit to eat.

11
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:53,582
Bees flew everywhere, drinking from the flowers.

12
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:57,267
It was like being in a magical world.

13
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:03,165
Dickon pushed the chair slowly around the garden so Colin could see everything.

14
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:07,823
After a while Mary and Dickon decided to work a little.

15
00:01:07,823 --> 00:01:12,261
They dug and cleaned around the flowers while Colin watched them.

16
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:16,307
Colin kept seeing the birds flying through the air.

17
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:20,327
They were bringing pieces of food to their little ones.

18
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:26,237
"It looks like the birds are having their afternoon tea," he said to Dickon and Mary.

19
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:29,327
They all laughed at this idea.

20
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:33,213
Soon the thought of afternoon tea made them hungry.

21
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:37,471
"Go and make one of the servants bring some in a basket.

22
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:42,801
You can go and meet them at the kitchen door," said Colin.

23
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:46,119
It was agreed that this was a very good idea.

24
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,239
Soon they were having a wonderful afternoon meal.

25
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,692
There was hot tea, and bread, and cake.

26
00:01:54,692 --> 00:01:58,972
Dickon's little squirrels took pieces of bread and ate them.

27
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:03,238
His large black bird had a large piece of cake,

28
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:06,227
and seemed to enjoy it very much.

29
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,928
They ate quietly for a while.

30
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:14,984
Soon Colin said, "I don't want this afternoon to end.

31
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:20,434
But I'll come back tomorrow, and every day after that.

32
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:23,686
I'll get fresh air every day!

33
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:28,310
I've seen the spring now, and I'll see the summer.

34
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,946
I'll watch everything grow here, and I'll grow here, too!"

35
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:37,727
"Certainly you will!" said Dickon.

36
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:41,875
"We'll have you walking and digging with us, before long."

37
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:49,950
Colin's face turned red. "Walk?" he said. "Dig? Will I?"

38
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,063
Dickon looked at him carefully. So did Mary.

39
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:58,791
Neither of them knew if anything was really wrong with Colin's legs.

40
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:02,266
Could he walk, if he wanted to?

41
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:09,055
"Of course you'll walk. You- you've got legs, the same as other people!"

42
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:13,045
Mary felt worried until Colin answered.

43
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:17,964
"Nothing's really wrong with my legs," he said.

44
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,906
"They're very thin and weak, however.

45
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:25,167
I always thought I shouldn't walk,

46
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:28,679
and all the doctors and nurses did too.

47
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:33,726
So I haven't tried to for a long time.

48
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:40,303
They shake so much that I'm afraid to try to stand up."

49
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,057
Dickon and Mary both felt better.

50
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:49,153
"When you stop being afraid, you'll stand on them," said Dickon cheerfully.

51
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:52,884
"And you'll stop being afraid pretty soon!"

52
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:57,587
"I will!" said Colin, as if it surprised him.

53
00:03:57,587 --> 00:04:01,605
They lay still for a while, enjoying the day.

54
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:07,982
Suddenly, Colin whispered, "Mary! Dickon! Who is that man?"

55
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:12,757
Dickon and Mary jumped up and looked where Colin was pointing.

56
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:17,179
Ben Weatherstaff was there, on the other side of the wall!

57
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:22,874
They saw his angry face looking at them, over the top of the wall.

58
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:28,776
He had climbed up a ladder on the other side. he shook his head at him.

59
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:34,363
"If you were my child," he cried, looking angrily at Mary,

60
00:04:34,363 --> 00:04:37,204
"I'd beat you, that's for sure!

61
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:43,321
I always knew you were a bad child - always asking questions.

62
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:47,103
I don't know why I made friends with you.

63
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:50,685
Now, if it hadn't been for that robin- "

64
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:58,037
"But, Ben Weatherstaff," cried Mary, "It was the robin who showed me the way in!"

65
00:04:58,037 --> 00:05:01,607
Ben looked like he wanted to jump over the wall.

66
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:08,153
"That's ridiculous! Don't blame the robin for this," he said sternly.

67
00:05:08,153 --> 00:05:11,451
But Mary could see he was really curious.

68
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:14,212
"How did you ever get in here?"

69
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:21,211
"Ben Weatherstaff, I can't tell you when you're shaking your fist at me like this," said Mary.

70
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:24,813
Colin had been watching all this from his chair.

71
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:29,341
Ben hadn't seen him yet. He had to do something.

72
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:35,093
"Push me over there! I want to talk to that man!" he whispered to Dickon.

73
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:39,322
Then Ben Weatherstaff saw something that amazed him.

74
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:44,138
Coming toward him was a large chair that looked like a king's chair.

75
00:05:44,138 --> 00:05:48,243
In the chair sat a boy who looked like a prince.

76
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:53,759
He had enormous gray eyes and was thin and very white.

77
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,742
But to Ben, it seemed that the ghost of Mrs. Craven was looking at him.

78
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:02,484
Colin looked so much like his mother.

79
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:04,895
He couldn't believe his eyes.

80
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:10,399
"Do you know who I am?" said Colin. "Answer me!"

81
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:19,704
"Do- do I know who you are? Of course - your mother's eyes looking at me, from your face.

82
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:25,262
I don't know how you came here. You're the poor crippled boy."

83
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:30,306
Colin sat up in his chair. He was not a cripple!

84
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,783
He wasn't going to let this poor gardener think so.

85
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:38,855
He might have a weak back, but there was nothing wrong with his legs.

86
00:06:38,855 --> 00:06:44,299
"Listen, you! I am not a cripple!" he cried.

87
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:51,931
"He's not!" shouted Mary. "He's really not! And he's not a hunchback, either.

88
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:55,237
I looked and there's not even one lump there!"

89
00:06:55,237 --> 00:07:00,693
Ben didn't know what to think. He put his hand over his eyes.

90
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:05,520
"You - you haven't got bad legs?" he asked.

91
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,713
"NO!" shouted Colin. "And - you haven't got a bad back?"

92
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:17,299
"Come here! Come here!" Colin shouted to Dickon.

93
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:23,560
Dickon ran over to help him! "Take these blankets off me. I'll show him!"

94
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,239
Dickon threw off the blankets that covered Colin.

95
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:30,642
Colin's anger gave his body strength.

96
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:36,671
Mary watched him, thinking."He can do it! He can! He can!"

97
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:42,671
Slowly, with his hand on Dickon's arm, Colin stood up.

98
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:46,240
He stared at Ben Weatherstaff angrily.

99
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,790
His back was straight, and his legs were straight.

100
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,306
His head was held up proudly.

101
00:07:54,306 --> 00:08:00,519
"There! Look at me, you! Just look at me!" he said.

102
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:06,698
Ben Weatherstaff burst into tears. He never thought he would see this boy.

103
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:09,955
He had loved the boy's mother very much.

104
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:14,607
To see her son standing before him was like a miracle.

105
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:22,982
"The lies people tell!" Ben cried. "You're as thin and white as a ghost,

106
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:25,503
but you'll grow up to be a man."

107
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:31,932
"I'm your master, while my father is gone!" Colin said to Ben.

108
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:36,251
"You must obey me. This is my garden.

109
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:39,431
You cannot tell anyone we are here!

110
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:42,242
Now, get down from the ladder.

111
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:46,971
Miss Mary will meet you at the door and bring you to me.

112
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:53,148
We did not want you, but now you have to know the secret, too. Be quick!"

113
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:58,282
"My boy!" whispered Ben. "My boy!"

114
00:08:58,282 --> 00:09:00,949
He couldn't take his eyes off Colin.

115
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:04,076
Then he seemed to remember where he was.

116
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:08,969
"Yes, sir! Yes, sir!" he said, and climbed down the ladder.

117
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:14,856
Mary ran to meet Ben. While she was doing this, Colin said to Dickon,

118
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:19,400
"Dickon, I am going to walk over to that cherry tree.

119
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,951
I want to be standing when Weatherstaff comes here.

120
00:09:23,951 --> 00:09:31,088
Put a rug under the tree. When I want to sit down, I will, but not before."

121
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:35,098
His cheeks were red, and he didn't look tired at all.

122
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:40,269
Dickon held Colin's arm, but Colin was strong on his feet.

123
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:44,301
He slowly walked over to the tree and stood there.

124
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:47,648
Then Mary and Ben Weatherstaff entered.

125
00:09:47,648 --> 00:09:51,580
Mary had been telling Ben about Colin's recovery.

126
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,627
The important thing that Ben must remember was that Colin was getting well.

127
00:09:56,627 --> 00:10:02,734
Nothing could be said about sickness, or dying, or back problems.

128
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:06,610
"Come here, Weatherstaff," Colin said to Ben.

129
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,055
"Now, look at me! Do I have bad legs, or a bad back?"

130
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:20,318
"No, sir!" cried Ben. "It's a miracle, I never thought I'd see you, my boy.

131
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:23,683
What have you been doing all your life?

132
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:27,179
You've been hiding away in your room."

133
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,856
"Well, that's over now, " said Colin firmly.

134
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:36,651
"Everyone thought I was going to die, but I'm not!"

135
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:44,741
"Of course you're not. Not you! You've got too much strength in you," said Ben.

136
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:52,366
"Now sit down on the rug for a while, young Master, and give me my orders."

137
00:10:52,366 --> 00:10:56,564
"What do you do here, Weatherstaff?" asked Colin.

138
00:10:56,564 --> 00:11:00,977
"I work in all the gardens," said Ben.

139
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:08,238
"Master Craven lets me stay here, because- because your mother liked me."

140
00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:16,969
"My mother!" said Colin. He looked around. "This was her garden, wasn't it?"

141
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:28,270
"Yes. She loved it very much. She once said to me, 'Ben, if I'm ever ill, or I go away,

142
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:35,994
you must take care of my roses." She loved those roses, like they were her children!

143
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:40,718
"Well, it is my garden now," said Colin.

144
00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:45,587
"I love it, too. I will come here every day.

145
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:49,578
Mary and Dickon have done a lot of work here.

146
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:51,958
You cannot tell anyone.

147
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,058
You will come here sometimes, and help us.

148
00:11:55,058 --> 00:12:00,486
But you must come when no one can see you," he said to Ben.

149
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:06,198
"Yes,sir. I'll come whenever you want me," said Ben.

150
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:08,988
He was very happy with this plan.

151
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:14,423
"I'm glad you knew my mother, Weatherstaff," said Colin.

152
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:17,733
"You'll know how to keep the secret."

153
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:20,578
Colin picked up Mary's little shovel.

154
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:23,968
He pushed it into the dirt and tried to dig.

155
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:29,727
His hand was still very weak and thin, so he couldn't push very deep.

156
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:33,094
But soon he turned some soil over.

157
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:38,446
"Do you want to plant something, young Master?" asked Ben.

158
00:12:38,446 --> 00:12:41,398
"I can get you a rose in a pot."

159
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:45,581
"Go and get it!" said Colin excitedly.

160
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:49,730
Dickon quickly dug a wide, deep hole in the ground.

161
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,032
When Ben brought the rose, he took it out of its pot.

162
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:56,300
He handed it to Colin.

163
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,927
"Here, boy," he said.

164
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,258
"Put it in the ground yourself,

165
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:05,896
like a king does when he goes to a new place."

166
00:13:05,896 --> 00:13:09,288
Colin placed the rose in the hole in the ground.

167
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,630
Then Dickon and Ben put dirt around the plant.

168
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,143
They pressed it down firmly.

169
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:18,598
"It's planted!" said Colin.

170
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:21,982
"Look, the sun is going down.

171
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:26,742
I want to be standing when it leaves the sky. Help me, Dickon."

172
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:32,806
And when the sun went down, Colin was standing on his feet, laughing.

173
00:13:32,806 --> 00:13:36,864
It seemed there really was magic in the garden.

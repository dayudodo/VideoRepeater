00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,201
CHAPTER SIXTEEN "I WILL LIVE FOREVER!"

2
00:00:05,201 --> 00:00:08,909
The next morning Mary slept very late.

3
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,726
When Martha brought her breakfast, she said,

4
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:14,656
"Well, Miss Mary, I don't believe it.

5
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:17,499
This morning Master Colin asked me,

6
00:00:17,499 --> 00:00:21,319
'Would you please ask Miss Mary if she'll come and see me, when she can?'

7
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:24,109
Imagine him saying 'please'!"

8
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:27,130
Mary wanted to go straight to the garden.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,032
But suddenly she decide to go and see Colin.

10
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:35,481
She felt that she could trust him with the secret of the garden.

11
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:40,304
When she entered Colin's room she had her coat and hat with her.

12
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:44,072
She intended to go to the garden after speaking with him.

13
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:47,217
"I'm glad you came," he said.

14
00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:51,379
He looked very tired. "Are you going somewhere?"

15
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:54,986
"Well, I'm going to see Dickon soon.

16
00:00:54,986 --> 00:01:00,170
I...I thought I'd tell you something. About the garden."

17
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,666
"What is it?" Colin looked excited.

18
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,467
Mary felt a little afraid again.

19
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:12,366
"Can I trust you? Really, really trust you?

20
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:15,118
I trusted Dickon with the secret.

21
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,603
Will you promise never to tell anyone?"

22
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:25,242
"I promise, Mary," whispered Colin. He saw she was very serious.

23
00:01:25,242 --> 00:01:28,410
"I've found the door to the garden.

24
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,650
I really found it weeks ago.

25
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,625
I wasn't sure if I could trust you,

26
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,787
so I didn't say anything.

27
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:38,294
Dickon and I have been working in it,

28
00:01:38,294 --> 00:01:43,500
and in summer there will be roses and many other beautiful things."

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,241
Colin's eyes were as big as plates. "Mary!" he cried.

30
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:53,819
"Oh, will I see it? Will I live to get into it?"

31
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,226
He grabbed her hands and pulled her towards him.

32
00:01:57,226 --> 00:02:03,817
"Don't be ridiculous!" said Mary. "Of course you'll live to get into it!"

33
00:02:03,817 --> 00:02:08,107
And Colin saw how silly he was, and began to laugh.

34
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:10,268
Mary laughed with him.

35
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:14,240
She told him about what the secret garden was really like.

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,849
She told him about the wonderful work they were doing there.

37
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:23,289
Soon, they looked like two ordinary children, whispering and laughing.

38
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:27,645
Colin felt better than he ever had in his life.

39
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:31,550
They began to make plans for Colin's visit to the garden.

40
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:40,369
"I have an idea," said Colin, "I must see this garden, tomorrow, if the weather's good.

41
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:46,400
Oh, let it be good! Dickon can push me in my wheel chair.

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,609
I'll tell all the gardeners to keep away from the place where the secret garden is.

43
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:56,359
I'll just say I want to be left alone.

44
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,705
I'm sure it will work!"

45
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:02,166
Meanwhile, the doctor arrived at the house.

46
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,782
He hated these visits.

47
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:09,673
He expected the boy to be alone, and still angry and upset.

48
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:14,139
he usually was, the morning after his tantrums.

49
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:17,515
But Mrs. Medlock had different news for him.

50
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:20,526
"Doctor, you'll never believe it.

51
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:26,888
That sour faced little girl, who's almost as bad as Colin, has calmed him.

52
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:31,005
Last night she did what all of us are afraid to do.

53
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:35,375
She just ran into the room and yelled at him to stop.

54
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:40,589
She said he was being ridiculous! Now, this afternoon, well,

55
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:44,633
you have to see for yourself. Come upstairs."

56
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:48,816
The doctor saw Colin and Mary talking and laughing.

57
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:51,520
Colin actually looked happy!

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,978
They were looking at some pictures of flowers.

59
00:03:54,978 --> 00:04:00,919
"These large, purple flowers are called delphiniums," said Colin.

60
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,621
"We've got some of those in the garden already!" said Mary.

61
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,205
Then they saw the doctor and stopped speaking.

62
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:15,622
"Well, my boy. you are looking better after your long night," said the doctor.

63
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:19,969
"I'm feeling much better. I want some fresh air,

64
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:26,994
so I'm going out in my chair tomorrow, if the weather's nice," said Colin boldly.

65
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:32,421
The doctor was shocked. Colin had said that he hated fresh air.

66
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:36,919
"Well, all right, but it must be warm tomorrow.

67
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:41,512
And you must dress warmly," he said nervously.

68
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:45,444
"Never mind, doctor. You may go away now.

69
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:48,067
I do not need any medicine.

70
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:50,475
My cousin makes me better.

71
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:58,180
When I go outside, a very strong boy I know can push my chair," said Colin.

72
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:05,433
"Who is this boy?" asked the doctor. "He's Dickon!" said Mary.

73
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:09,469
The doctor smiled. Everyone knew Dickon.

74
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:14,202
"Well, if Dickon goes with you it will be all right."

75
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:18,064
When the doctor left he went straight to Mrs. Medlock.

76
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:22,954
"Sarah, I don't believe it. You were right.

77
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:28,058
That little girl has tamed him, like you tame a wild animal!

78
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:33,994
I didn't have to give him any sleeping pills, or do anything for him."

79
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:39,295
"I know. I'm very relived," said Mr. Medlock.

80
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:43,846
After a while, Mary left Colin and went to the garden,

81
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:47,254
where she worked happily with Dickon for hours.

82
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:51,515
They had agreed that tomorrow was to be the day of the adventure,

83
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,328
if the sun shone.

84
00:05:53,328 --> 00:06:00,218
Unfortunately, Mary, Colin, and Dickon's plan had to wait more than a week.

85
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:04,723
First Colin got a cold, and the weather was also bad.

86
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:09,488
It was cool and windy every day for ten days.

87
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:15,640
Normally, such a situation would have made Colin terribly angry and upset.

88
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:21,757
But Mary came to see him every day, and he and Mary had such pleasant conversations.

89
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,734
They almost always talked about the garden.

90
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:27,544
Mary told him what was growing there.

91
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:32,026
Like Mary, he was also interested in the roses.

92
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:36,457
The rose vines and bushes were becoming greener every day.

93
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:40,905
When summer came, there would be roses of every color,

94
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:45,135
pink,red,white,and yellow.

95
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:48,580
Many other kinds of flowers were growing, too.

96
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,027
During this time Colin met Dickon.

97
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:56,043
Mary had wondered what the two boys would think of each other.

98
00:06:56,043 --> 00:06:59,617
But she saw she didn't need to worry.

99
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:04,569
Colin just stared and stared at Dickon with amazement in his eyes.

100
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:07,997
He had never talked to another boy before.

101
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:12,487
But Dickon was so natural, and not at all embarrassed,

102
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:15,231
that Colin didn't feel shy at all.

103
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:20,611
After that, every day Dickon came to the room for a short time.

104
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:23,679
Finally the weather got better.

105
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:28,369
Ten days after Colin's terrible night, he awakened.

106
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:32,478
He was happy it was morning, which surprised him a little.

107
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:35,229
He usually hated being awake.

108
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:38,853
He could see the warm sun shining outside!

109
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:43,047
This afternoon, if his and Mary's plan worked,

110
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,895
he would see the mysterious garden.

111
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:50,941
Colin rang his bell. When his nurse came in, he said.

112
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:56,919
"Nurse, ask Mary Lennox if she will have breakfast with me here.

113
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,721
And go and find Mr. Roach, the gardener.

114
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:02,826
I want to speak to him."

115
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:07,519
The nurse was surprised, but she did as Colin asked.

116
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,193
Half an hour later, Mary and Colin were eating breakfast together.

117
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:15,471
Colin was surprised to find that he was hungry.

118
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:19,655
"You'll become fatter, just like I did," said Mary.

119
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:24,047
"I used to never want my food, and now I'm always hungry."

120
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:27,431
Soon Mr. Roach, the gardener, appeared.

121
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:33,231
He had no idea what Master Colin could want, and he was curious about him.

122
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:35,401
He had never seen the boy,

123
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:40,349
but he'd heard stories of the boy's terrible temper and his illnesses.

124
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:44,307
That morning, Coin was sitting in a chair.

125
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:48,924
He had on a red gown that made him look a little like a prince.

126
00:08:48,924 --> 00:08:55,380
"So you are Roach, are you?" Colin said. "I want you to do some things."

127
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:01,345
"Very good, sir," said Roach. He wondered what the boy would ask.

128
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:05,807
"This afternoon I am going out in my chair.

129
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:10,011
I will go out every day, if the weather is good.

130
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:17,887
I want you to make sure everyone stays away from the long path by the garden walls.

131
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:22,315
Do you understand? I will go out at two o'clock,

132
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:28,742
and everyone is to stay away until I say they may return to work."

133
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:33,545
"Very good,sir. It will be done," said Roach.

134
00:09:33,545 --> 00:09:39,107
He was glad the boy hadn't told him to chop all the trees down, or something like that!

135
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:42,802
"You may go now, Roach," said Colin.

136
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:49,194
He acted just like a Prince of England! Mr. Roach almost wanted to laugh.

137
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:52,787
Mary stayed with Colin for the rest of the morning.

138
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:55,779
The nurse would dress Colin at one thirty.

139
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:00,693
Then Dickon would come up and meet them in Colin's room at two o'clock.

140
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:05,547
Mary wasn't worried that Colin wouldn't like Dickon. Everyone did.

141
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:10,013
They became more and more excited as the time went by.

142
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:13,365
Finally the nurse came in to dress Colin.

143
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:16,491
She noticed that, instead of lying there,

144
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,923
Colin tried to help her a little.

145
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:21,459
And he talked to Mary the whole time.

146
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:24,433
Then they helped him get into his wheel chair.

147
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:29,095
The strongest servant in the house carried Colin and the chair downstairs.

148
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,861
Mary saw Dickon waiting for them.

149
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:33,453
He looked excited.

150
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:39,027
When everything was ready, Colin said to the servants,"You may go now."

151
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:43,909
They did so, but they were trying not to laugh at the little Prince!

152
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:47,611
Outside it was a beautiful spring day.

153
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:53,397
The wind was warm, the sun shone, the sky was a soft blue.

154
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:56,901
Colin looked around him and breathed deeply.

155
00:10:56,901 --> 00:11:01,811
"There are so many birds singing!" he said.

156
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:06,391
"They're all busy buidling their nests, and laying their eggs.

157
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:09,601
Add just listen to those bees.

158
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:12,871
They're making honey," said Dickon.

159
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:17,409
while they walked Dickon showed Colin many sorts of flowers.

160
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:21,194
Many of them were now growing in the secret garden.

161
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:25,719
Soon they reached the wall where the door to the secret garden was.

162
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:28,501
Mr. Roach had kept his promise.

163
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:34,127
No one was around. "I don't see the door," said Colin.

164
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:38,809
He was breathing fast, and his eyes were shining with excitement.

165
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:43,869
"It's hiddnen - it's right here. Quickly, now!

166
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,877
Push him in, Dickon - fast!" whispered Mary.

167
00:11:47,877 --> 00:11:51,140
And Dickon pushed Colin into the garden.

168
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,437
Colin had covered his eyes with his hands.

169
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:58,341
When he took them away, he cried out in joy.

170
00:11:58,341 --> 00:12:03,667
To Colin, the garden was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.

171
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:07,416
The rose vines on the wall were green and healthy.

172
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:14,461
Flowers of every color were growing, and the grass was soft, green, and fresh.

173
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:17,111
There was a sound of birds singing,

174
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,993
and delicious smells filled the air.

175
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:25,887
It was sweet and quiet, and the sun was warm on his face.

176
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:29,495
Mary and Dickon stared at Colin in amazement.

177
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:35,993
They noticed the boy's white face filling with pink color, as he took deep breaths.

178
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:42,743
"Mary!" he cried. "Dickon! I will get well! I will!

179
00:12:42,743 --> 00:12:45,873
The garden's magic will help me.

180
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:50,760
And I will live forever and ever and ever!"

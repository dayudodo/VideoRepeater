CHAPTER TEN DICKON

2
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:07,971
For one week after this and the sun shone on the secret garden.

3
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:13,280
Mary loved being inside the garden's walls,safely hidden away from the world.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,612
It was like being in a magical land.

5
00:00:16,612 --> 00:00:19,511
Because of her time spent in the garden,

6
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:22,594
Mary was beginning to like being outside.

7
00:00:22,594 --> 00:00:25,671
She no longer hated the strong winds.

8
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:31,031
She could run faster and longer, and she was becoming stronger.

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:37,655
Mary was a strange, determined little girl, and now she had something to work for.

10
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:40,902
She spent hours in the garden that week.

11
00:00:40,902 --> 00:00:43,996
She pulled up dead grass and weeds.

12
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:48,107
She found more and more little green plants every day.

13
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:52,867
She wondered how long it would be before the plants turned into flowers.

14
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:56,247
When they came, there would be hundreds of them!

15
00:00:56,247 --> 00:01:01,234
During that week Mary became more friendly with Ben Weatherstaff.

16
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:05,613
They talked a little, and wathced the robin sing and hop about.

17
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:10,335
Ben was not used to company, but he secretly enjoyed seeing Mary.

18
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:16,148
One day during that week Ben asked her, "How long have you been here?"

19
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:19,853
"About a month," said Mary.

20
00:01:19,853 --> 00:01:23,553
"You're beginning to look like a real little girl.

21
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:27,956
You're a little fatter, and not so yellow and ugly.

22
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:31,861
When you first came here, I said to myself,

23
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:36,535
'I've never seen an uglier more sour faced child!'"

24
00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:42,561
Mary did not care much about her looks, so this comment did not bother her.

25
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:48,423
"I know I'm fatter," she said. "My dresses are a little tigher now,

26
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:52,114
Look, Ben Weatherstaff, here comes the robin."

27
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:55,147
The robin looked especially good that day.

28
00:01:55,147 --> 00:02:01,286
His little gray and red body was fat and shiny,and his black eyes were bright.

29
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:05,794
He seemed to be trying to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him.

30
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:09,922
"Oh, there you are!" said Ben.

31
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:15,026
"You'll come and talk to me, when you haven't got anyone better.

32
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:18,012
I know what you've been doing.

33
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,711
You've been seeing some lady robin.

34
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:25,472
You'll be telling her you're the bravest bird on the moor!"

35
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:31,630
The little bird looked at Ben and hopped so close that Mary could almost touch him.

36
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,501
Then he did an amazing thing.

37
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:41,315
He flew and sat on top of Ben's gardening tool, only inches from his face.

38
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:45,106
Ben stood still as if he were afraid to breathe.

39
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:49,349
He didn't want to say anything, or the robin might fly away.

40
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:57,688
"I don't believe it," he whispered. "You know how to amaze a fellow, that's for sure!"

41
00:02:57,688 --> 00:03:03,122
He stood there without moving until the robin sang a little song and flew away.

42
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:07,452
Ben looked at his gardening tool as if it were a magic thing.

43
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:10,504
He didn't say anything for a few moments,

44
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:15,645
but he kept smiling. Mary wasn't afraid to speak to him.

45
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:20,298
"Do you have a garden, Ben Weatherstaff?" she asked.

46
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:27,138
"No," said Ben. "But if you had one, what would you plant in it?"

47
00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:32,522
"Cabbages and potatoes and onions," said Ben.

48
00:03:32,522 --> 00:03:35,736
"But what if you wanted to grow flowers?

49
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:39,536
What would you plant then?" continued Mary.

50
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:45,048
"Oh...sweet-smelling flowers. Mostly roses."

51
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:50,908
Mary was excited. She remembered the rose vines in the secret garden.

52
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:54,847
"Do you like roses?" she asked.

53
00:03:54,847 --> 00:04:03,929
"Yes, I do. A young lady I worked for loved them, and she taught me all about them.

54
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:09,140
She had a lot of roses in...a place she liked,

55
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,074
and she loved them like they were childrens," said Ben.

56
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:20,063
"That was ten years ago." "Where is she now?" asked Mary.

57
00:04:20,063 --> 00:04:23,323
"Heaven," said Ben.

58
00:04:23,323 --> 00:04:27,928
"What happened to her roses? Did they die, when she did?"

59
00:04:27,928 --> 00:04:34,469
"Well, for a few years after she died I went to took care of the roses.

60
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:39,888
I don't do that anymore, because I'm old and stiff.

61
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:43,032
But I think many of them lived."

62
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,311
Mary was more and more excited.

63
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:53,236
"Ben Weatherstaff, when some roses have no leaves, and look gray and brown and dry,

64
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:57,261
how do you know if they are dead or alive?" she cried.

65
00:04:57,261 --> 00:04:59,885
She had forgotten to be careful.

66
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:04,890
"When the spring comes, look at the branches of the rose plants.

67
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:10,403
If you see a small bump on the branches, they're alive.

68
00:05:10,403 --> 00:05:16,255
After a warm rain you'll see what happend. Now see here!

69
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:24,142
Why do you care about roses so much, all of a sudden?" he said, looking closely at Mary.

70
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:26,732
Mary's face grew red.

71
00:05:26,732 --> 00:05:34,814
"Well...I want to --to pretend that I have a garden," she said slowly.

72
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:41,070
"There is nothing for me to do. I have nothing - and no one."

73
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:48,040
"That's true," said Ben slowly as he wathced her. "You haven't."

74
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,444
Mary wondered if he felt sorry for her.

75
00:05:51,444 --> 00:05:57,828
She stayed with him for ten minutes more, asking him as many questions as she dared.

76
00:05:57,828 --> 00:06:00,704
He answered her in his strange way,

77
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:04,772
but Mary thought that he might be beginning to like her, a little.

78
00:06:04,772 --> 00:06:07,432
She stayed with him until he said,

79
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:13,778
"Now look here! Go and play. You ask too many questions!

80
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:16,742
I'm finished talking for today."

81
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:22,123
Instead of being angry, Mary cheerfully told him goodbye and left.

82
00:06:22,123 --> 00:06:27,565
She thought to herself that she liked old Ben, although he was cross.

83
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:30,288
She wanted to keep talking with him.

84
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:34,738
And he seemed to know everything in the world about flowers!

85
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:39,065
As Mary turned a corner she saw a very strange thing.

86
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,344
She couldn't believe her eyes.

87
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:46,210
A boy was sitting under the tree, playing a little wooden pipe.

88
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,169
He was a funny looking bird, about twelve years old.

89
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:53,865
He had red cheeks and bright blue eyes.

90
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:57,284
They were as blue and bright as the sky.

91
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:02,662
But the most amazing thing was that there were animals all around him.

92
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:06,375
A squirrel and two rabbits were sitting near him.

93
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:12,067
They didn't seem afraid at all; they almost seemed to be listening to the music.

94
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:16,703
When the boy saw Mary he spoke to her in a low voice.

95
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:21,281
"Don't you move," he said. "It would scare them."

96
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:27,259
Mary didn't move. The boy put his pipe in his pocket and stood up,

97
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:31,594
so slowly that he hardly moved at all.

98
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:35,735
When he did, the rabbits and squirrel moved away.

99
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:38,859
They still didn't seem frightened, however.

100
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:44,647
"I'm Dickon," said the boy. "I know you're Miss Mary."

101
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:49,008
Mary realized that she had known this was Dickon from the beginning.

102
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:51,041
Who else could it have been?

103
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:55,409
Dickon had a wide smile, and it filled his whole face.

104
00:07:55,409 --> 00:08:02,041
"I stood up so slowly because wild animals don't like it when you move fast.

105
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:06,548
You have to move slow, and speak softly."

106
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:10,511
He spoke to Mary as if he'd known her a long time.

107
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:15,809
However, Mary knew nothing about boys, so she felt a little shy.

108
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:20,186
"Did you get Martha's letter?" she asked.

109
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:24,629
"Yes, that's why I came," said Dickon.

110
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,489
He pointed to a little package on the ground.

111
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:31,815
"I've got your garden tools and seeds."

112
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:36,065
"Will you show the seeds to me?" asked Mary.

113
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:40,091
Looking at Dickon's friendly face she forgot to be shy.

114
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:44,713
"Let's sit on this log and look at them together," she said.

115
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:48,007
They sat down and Dickon took out a package.

116
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:51,728
Inside were small envelopes of seeds.

117
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:56,838
"Here are some poppy seeds, and here's some mignonette.

118
00:08:56,838 --> 00:09:01,986
Mignonette flowers are the sweetest smelling in the world.

119
00:09:01,986 --> 00:09:07,942
They'll grow wherever you plant them, the same as the poppies!"

120
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:10,934
He explained to Mary how to water the seeds,

121
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:14,477
and what they would look like when they became flowers.

122
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:17,659
"Listen," he said suddenly.

123
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:22,542
"I'll plant them for you myself. Where's your garden?"

124
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:26,084
Mary's face turned red, then white.

125
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:28,900
She hadn't thought of this before.

126
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,348
How could she tell Dickon about the secret garden?

127
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:34,910
She didn't know what to say.

128
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,512
Dickon saw her reaction.

129
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:41,621
"Haven't you got a garden yet?" he asked.

130
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:44,428
"Wouldn't they give you a little one?"

131
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:48,056
Mary's eyes were huge, as she looked at him.

132
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:55,470
"I don't know anything about boys," she said slowly.

133
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:01,264
"If I tell you a very big secret, will you promise not to tell?

134
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:05,606
If anyone else found out... I think I would die!"

135
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,680
she said, almost angrily.

136
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:15,538
But Dickon just smiled. "I keep secrets all the time," he said.

137
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:21,889
"If I couldn't keep secrets from the other boys about animals' nests and things,

138
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,242
then no animal  on the moor would be safe.

139
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:28,614
Yes, I can keep secrets."

140
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:34,303
"I've...I've stolen a garden," whispered Mary.

141
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:38,593
"It's an old garden, more than ten years old.

142
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:42,036
Nobody wants it, they never enter it.

143
00:10:42,036 --> 00:10:46,236
Perhaps everything in it is dead, I don't know -

144
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:52,781
but I don't care, I don't! I have nothing here - nothing belongs to me.

145
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:54,767
I found it myself.

146
00:10:54,767 --> 00:11:00,013
No one has the right to take it away from me when I love it and they don't.

147
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:06,748
They're letting it die, all alone," she said, and burst into tears.

148
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:12,351
Dickon's blue eyes grew bigger and bigger. "Ahhhh!"

149
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:15,210
he said with pity and understanding.

150
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,776
"Where is it?" he whispered.

151
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:24,923
Mary got up at once. She was feeling a little like the old Mary - sour and angry -

152
00:11:24,923 --> 00:11:28,449
but at the same time very worried and upset.

153
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:31,234
"I'll show you," she said.

154
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:35,039
Mary took Dickon to the garden wall.

155
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,606
She lifted the thick vines and showed him the door.

156
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:42,415
She was careful to make sure no one was around.

157
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:46,298
When they passed through the garden door, Mary said,

158
00:11:46,298 --> 00:11:52,772
"This is the place. It's a secret garden, and I'm the only one who wants it to be alive."

159
00:11:52,772 --> 00:12:00,530
Dickon looked around and around him. "It's a strange, pretty place!" he whispered.

160
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,597
"It's like a place in a dream."

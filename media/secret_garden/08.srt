CHAPTER EIGHT THE ROBIN SHOWS THE WAY

2
00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:07,838
Mary looked at the key for a long time.

3
00:00:07,838 --> 00:00:13,342
All she could think about was that this key might let her into the secret garden!

4
00:00:13,342 --> 00:00:18,195
If she could only find where the door was, she could open it,

5
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:21,001
and discover what was behind the walls.

6
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,362
To Mary, the garden was a wonderful mystery.

7
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:26,905
If she could only enter the garden,

8
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:30,401
it might be different and better than other places.

9
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:34,395
"I could have my own secret place to play in.

10
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:38,678
No one would ever know!" thought Mary happily.

11
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:42,125
Everyone would think that the key was still hidden,

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,119
and the door was locked.

13
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:48,465
Mary loved the idea of having a secret from everyone else.

14
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,524
Since arriving at Misselthwaite Manor,

15
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:55,321
Mary's mind and body had begun to wake up a little.

16
00:00:55,321 --> 00:01:01,595
Being the only child in an enormous house with many rooms is a very strange thing.

17
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:09,019
And there wasn't any doubt that the cold,fresh English air was continuing to make her strong and healthy.

18
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:13,867
As her body grew stronger, her mind began to work more.

19
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:18,341
So Mary was very interested in the discovery of the old key,

20
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:20,585
and the mystery of the garden.

21
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:24,952
Mary put the key in her pocket and walked up and down.

22
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,587
She looked at the garden walls.

23
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:31,731
There were many thick, green vines covering the walls,

24
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:34,687
so that  you couldn't see the bricks underneath.

25
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:37,421
Mary felt a little frustrated.

26
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:40,857
There just had to be a door somewhere!

27
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:44,626
It seemed so silly to be so close to the garden,

28
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:47,385
and yet not to be able to enter!

29
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:52,707
Mary decided to always keep the key with her in case she ever found the door.

30
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:57,270
The next morning when Mary woke up Martha was there.

31
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,433
She had returned from her visit to her family,

32
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,973
and was feeling quite happy.

33
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:06,680
As Mary ate, Martha told her about her visit.

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,577
She had helped with the washing and baking,

35
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:13,284
and in the evening, the whole family had sat around the fire.

36
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:20,144
Martha had told her brothers and sisters all about the new girl at Misselthwaite Manor, who was from India.

37
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:26,456
"The children loved hearing about you! Their eyes almost fell out of their heads,

38
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:31,713
when I told them about the black people, and the ship you arrived in, and everything."

39
00:02:31,713 --> 00:02:36,454
Mary thought a little. "I'll tell you more stories of India,

40
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:40,085
so the next time you go home, you'll have more to talk about.

41
00:02:40,084 --> 00:02:43,957
Do you think the children would like to hear about riding on elephants

42
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:47,103
 and camels, and snake charmers, and magic men?"

43
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:52,963
"Oh,my!" cried Martha. "Of course they would.

44
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:55,665
Would you really do that, Miss Mary?"

45
00:02:55,665 --> 00:03:01,131
"Yes, India is very different from England," said Mary.

46
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:04,799
"Did Dickon and your mother like to hear you talk about me?"

47
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,059
"Why, of course! Dickon loved it.

48
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:11,091
However my mother was a little worried about you,

49
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:14,793
because you're alone so much," said Martha.

50
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:19,226
"Mother said, 'Hasn't Mr. Craven got a governess for her?"

51
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:23,228
"I don't want a governess!" said Mary loudly.

52
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:28,440
"Well, I told Mother that he'll probably not think about it for a few years.

53
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,963
But mother said you should be studying, and you should have a woman to take care of you.

54
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:38,514
She also said, 'Now, Martha, just think how you would feel,

55
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:42,828
a little girl with no mother, all alone in a big house!

56
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:48,130
Make sure to cheer her up.' I told her I would try."

57
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,418
Mary looked at Martha for a long time.

58
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:57,338
"You do cheer me up. I like to hear you talk," she said.

59
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:01,890
Then Martha left the room and came back with something in her hand.

60
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,544
"I've brought you a gift! It's from Mother."

61
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:09,192
"A gift? " said Mary.

62
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:14,370
How could someone with fouteen hungry people to feed give anyone a gift?

63
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,291
"It's a jumping rope.

64
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:22,966
Mother got it from a man who was sellling them near our house," said Martha.

65
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:26,550
 "She said to me, 'Well, Martha,

66
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,184
you've given me your month's salary like a good girl.

67
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:35,488
I've only a few small coins, but I'm going to buy that child a jumping rope.

68
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:37,610
She might enjoy it.'"

69
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,086
Mary looked at the jumping rope.

70
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:43,863
It had two red and blue wooden handles.

71
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:47,768
However, she had never seen a jumping rope before.

72
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:51,566
"What do you do with it?" she asked.

73
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:56,549
Martha laughed. "Watch!" she said.

74
00:04:56,549 --> 00:05:01,140
She took a handle in each hand and began to jump over the rope.

75
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,988
First she was slow, then she was faster and faster.

76
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:08,862
She skipped as she jumped.

77
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:11,918
Mary could see her cheeks getting red.

78
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:17,903
Martha went on skipping and jumping over the rope until she'd done it one hundred times.

79
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,982
Then she stopped.

80
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:22,592
"I could skip longer than that!

81
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:26,174
I've skipped five hundred times at once before.

82
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:29,460
But I wasn't as fat then as I am now!"

83
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,592
Martha said, and laughed. Mary felt excited.

84
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:40,369
"Your mother is a kind woman. Do you think I could learn to do that?"

85
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:45,533
"Just practice. You'll be slow at first, but you'll get better.

86
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:50,174
Mother said that a jumping rope is one of the best things for a child to do.

87
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:55,895
You'll get more strength in your arms and legs, and be out in the fresh air."

88
00:05:55,895 --> 00:06:02,122
Mary tried jumping rope a few times. She was slow!

89
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:07,218
"Put on your coat and go outside and practice," said Martha.

90
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:11,704
"Mother said I must tell you to play outside as much as possible.

91
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,463
Just as long as you keep warm!"

92
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:18,074
Mary put on her coat and got her jumping rope.

93
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:20,618
Suddenly she turned to Martha.

94
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:26,570
"Martha," she said slowly, "it was your money, really.

95
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,047
Thank you for the jumping rope."

96
00:06:29,047 --> 00:06:33,200
Martha just laughed. "Run outside and play."

97
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,304
The jumping rope was a wonderful thing.

98
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:40,086
Mary jumped rope until her cheeks were very red.

99
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:44,419
The sun had begun to shine, and a fresh wind blew.

100
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,838
Mary skipped around some of the gardens.

101
00:06:47,838 --> 00:06:52,578
she saw Ben Weatherstaff working and talking to the robin,

102
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,616
which was hopping on the ground next to him.

103
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:59,594
Using the jumping rope, Mary skipped over to him.

104
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:04,833
Ben looked at her curiously. Mary wanted him to notice her.

105
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:13,478
"Well!" he said. "What a surprise! Perhaps you're a real child after all,

106
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:18,930
instead of a sour old woman. Your cheeks are nice and red."

107
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,017
"I've never jumped rope before," said Mary.

108
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:26,517
"I can only jump twenty times in a row."

109
00:07:26,517 --> 00:07:30,136
"Keep practicing," said Ben.

110
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:37,587
"Look, the robin is watching you. He followed you yesterday, and he'll do it again.

111
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:41,787
He wants to know what a jumping rope is."

112
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:45,408
Mary jumped rope around the gardens for a while.

113
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:50,209
Soon she decided to practice near the walls of the secret garden.

114
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:54,885
She soon found that she could jump more than twenty times in a row.

115
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:58,068
She was very hot, but she felt good.

116
00:07:58,068 --> 00:08:02,065
She looked down at the ground, and there was the robin!

117
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:06,347
"Well, robin, you showed me the key to the garden.

118
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:08,886
Now you should show me the door,

119
00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:14,534
but I don't think you know where it is!" said Mary, smiling at the bird.

120
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:20,185
The robin looked at Mary, as if to say, "What do you think?"

121
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:24,858
He jumped onto a tree and sang a loud, lovely song.

122
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:30,691
Now, Mary Lennox had heard a lot about magic from her Indian Ayi's stories.

123
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:37,750
In later years, Mary always said that what happened to her at this very moment was magic.

124
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,997
The wind began to blow suddenly.

125
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:45,012
The wind was strong enough to blow the branches of the thick,

126
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:48,723
green vines that covered the walls of the secret garden.

127
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:52,122
Mary, who had stepped close to the robin,

128
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:55,464
suddenly jumped out and caught the vines in her hand.

129
00:08:55,464 --> 00:08:57,662
She had seen something.

130
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,862
It was a doorknob!

131
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:03,447
Mary put her hands under the thick leaves.

132
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:06,652
She pulled and pushed them aside.

133
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:11,808
Yes, there was a door in the wall of the secret garden!

134
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:17,683
She had found it! Mary's heart was pounding with excitement.

135
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:23,134
The robin was singing loudly, as if he were just as excited.

136
00:09:23,134 --> 00:09:25,776
And the door had a key hole!

137
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:29,430
Mary took out the old key from her pocket.

138
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,623
She pushed it in the key hole.

139
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:35,795
She had to turn the key with both hands, but it worked.

140
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:39,878
Then Mary took a deep breath and looked around her.

141
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:45,104
There was no one coming. No one had seen her open the door.

142
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:49,260
Mary pushed back the leaves again and opened the door.

143
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:55,272
It hadn't been opened in ten years, so it opened very slowly.

144
00:09:55,272 --> 00:09:58,857
Then she went through the door and shut it behind her.

145
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:02,284
She stood around looking amazed.

146
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:06,394
She was standing inside the secret garden.

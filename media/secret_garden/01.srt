CHAPTER ONE THE CHILD WHO WAS LEFT BEHIND

4
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:26,812
When Mary Lennox left India to live in England, no one was sad to see her go.

5
00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:30,782
She was the most terrible little girl they knew.

6
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:35,414
Mary was not pretty,  and she was not nice either.

7
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:37,194
She was very thin.

8
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:43,605
She had thin yellow hair, and her face always had a mean, angry expression.

9
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:46,760
Her parents were very busy people.

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,484
They did not pay attention to Mary.

11
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:53,970
Mary's father worked for the English Government in India.

12
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,491
Her mother was very beautiful and went to lots of parties.

13
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:01,544
Mary's parents had not wanted a child.

14
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:06,200
When Mary was born they gave the baby to an Indian Ayi.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,680
They told the Ayi to keep her out of their sight.

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,697
As Mary grew up, she spent all her time with the Ayi and the other servants.

17
00:01:15,697 --> 00:01:22,559
These people let Mary do whatever she wanted, and they gave her everything she wanted.

18
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:28,245
This was because they knew that if Mary cried, she would disturb her parents.

19
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:31,752
Then her parents would become angry with the servants.

20
00:01:31,752 --> 00:01:37,257
So Mary became a very selfish, angry, and lonely girl.

21
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:39,965
She did not have any friends.

22
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:45,082
All the teachers who came to teach Mary how to read and write left,

23
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:47,611
because Mary did not behave well.

24
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:54,229
Fortunately, she was intelligent, so she learned how to read and write anyway.

25
00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:00,010
However, in a few short days Mary's life was changed.

26
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:07,734
She woke up one morning to discover that her parents had died in the night of a terrible disease called cholera.

27
00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:10,856
Many of the servants had died, too.

28
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:17,347
An officer came to the house to search for survivors, and found Mary there, alone.

29
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:21,268
For some reason the child hadn't become ill.

30
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:26,015
Mary had liked to look at her mother, because she was so young and pretty.

31
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:29,405
But Mary had not known her mother, or her father.

32
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:33,074
So she did not feel very sad that they were dead.

33
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:38,595
Mary was a very selfish child, and she only thought about herself.

34
00:02:38,595 --> 00:02:41,689
She wondered who would take care of her now.

35
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:44,249
She hoped that they would be polite to her.

36
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:49,248
She wanted them to give her whatever she wanted, like her Ayi had.

37
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:55,165
Mary was taken to the house of an English man named Mr. Crawford.

38
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:58,313
She was going to stay there for a while.

39
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:03,831
Mary did not like the man's family. He had five children.

40
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:07,727
At first the children tried to be nice to Mary.

41
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:13,347
However, she was so unkind to them that no one would play with her.

42
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:17,566
They called her names, which made her very angry.

43
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:23,661
Basil, the little boy, called her "Mistress Mary Quite Contrary".

44
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:28,476
After Mary had been there for two weeks, Basil said to Mary,

45
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:32,723
"I heard that you're going home at the end of the week.

46
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:36,271
I'm glad, I don't like you."

47
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:43,886
"I'm glad, too. And I don't like you, either!" said Mary. "Where is home?"

48
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:50,747
"You're going to your uncle's house, in England," said Basil.

49
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:53,914
"I heard my parents talking about it.

50
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:59,308
You'll be very unhappy there. Your uncle's a hunchback!"

51
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:03,289
"What a hunchback?" said Mary.

52
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:07,752
"It's a man who has a large hump on his back.

53
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:14,109
Just like a camel. Your uncle is a horrible monster!" said Basil.

54
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:17,614
"He lives in a large house in the country.

55
00:04:17,614 --> 00:04:20,166
No one ever goes there.

56
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:24,277
He won't let them, because he hates people."

57
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:31,692
"Go away. I don't believe you," said Mary. She put her fingers in her ears.

58
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:35,225
But Mary thought about what Basil had told her.

59
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:40,721
When Mrs. Crawford told Mary that she was going to live in England with her uncle,

60
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:44,016
Archibald Craven, Mary said nothing.

61
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:46,765
She looked as if she didn't care.

62
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:51,905
Basil's parents did not know what to think of this strange child.

63
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:58,533
A few days later Mary got on a large boat, and traveled to England.

64
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,797
She traveled with an English woman.

65
00:05:00,797 --> 00:05:06,349
The woman was very busy with her own chidlren, and did not pay much attention to her.

66
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:13,351
When the boat reached London, a woman named Mrs. Medlock was waiting for Mary.

67
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:17,573
Mrs. Medlock was Archibald Craven's housekeeper.

68
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:20,725
She was strong and fat looking.

69
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:26,209
She had grey hair, red cheeks, and large black eyes.

70
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,885
She did not think well of Mary.

71
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:35,045
"She's rather ugly, isn't she?" Mrs. Medlock said to the English woman.

72
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:38,119
"We heard her mother was beautiful.

73
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:41,455
The child did not receive her mother's looks!"

74
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:47,499
"Oh, I think she's be prettier when she's older," said the other woman kindly.

75
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:53,198
"She's just very thin. The weather in India is not good for young children."

76
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:59,783
"Well, there's nothing for children at Misselthwaite Manor," said Mrs. Medlock.

77
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:04,061
Misselthwaite Manor was Mr. Archibald Craven's house.

78
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:08,764
The women thought Mary was not listening, but she was.

79
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:12,399
She was looking at all the sights and sounds of London.

80
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,583
She wondered what her uncle would be like.

81
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,593
Was he really a hunchback?

82
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:20,324
She had never seen a hunchback.

83
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:22,654
Maybe India didn't have them.

84
00:06:22,654 --> 00:06:27,187
Since she had been living with the Crawfords, Mary had felt lonely.

85
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,519
She thought about the Crawford children.

86
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,918
They seemed to belong with their parents, who loved them.

87
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:35,874
She felt that her parents hadn't loved her.

88
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:39,279
None of the servants had loved her, either.

89
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,258
She did not know that this was because she was an unpleasant child.

90
00:06:44,258 --> 00:06:47,294
No one had ever taught her to be kind.

91
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:50,921
Mary did not even know that she was unpleasant.

92
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:53,741
She often thought that others were unpleasant.

93
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:57,096
But she did not know that she was unpleasant, herself.

94
00:06:57,096 --> 00:07:02,573
The next day Mary and Mrs. Medlock began the journey to Yorkshire,

95
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:04,719
where Misselthwaite Manor was.

96
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:08,223
Mary sat in the train and did not speak.

97
00:07:08,223 --> 00:07:11,481
Mrs. Medlock looked at Mary's face.

98
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:15,345
It looked very sour, just like a lemon!

99
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:20,939
She thought, "I've never seen an unhappier child in my life."

100
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,445
Mrs. Medlock did not really like children.

101
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,985
But she decided to tell Mary about her new home, anyway.

102
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:33,286
"Did your parents ever tell you about your uncle?" she asked Mary.

103
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:40,236
"No," said Mary. "Well, you are going to a very strange place.

104
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:44,291
Misselthwaite Manor is over six hundred years old.

105
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:48,857
The house has more than a hundred rooms, but most of them are locked.

106
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:51,838
The house is on the edge of the moor.

107
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:56,610
The moor is a large, flat land with grass and hills.

108
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,305
The house has many gardens.

109
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:01,945
But there's nothing else," she said.

110
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:05,129
Mary tried to pretend that she didn't care.

111
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,003
The woman look at her curiously.

112
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:12,870
"You like an old woman, not a child." she said.

113
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:18,815
"Don't you care? It doesn't matter whether I care or not." said Mary.

114
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:22,020
"You're right." said Mrs. Medlock.

115
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:25,935
"You have to live in Misselthwaite, whether you like it or not.

116
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:30,685
It's the easiest things, your uncle isn't going to see you.

117
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:36,117
He doesn't see anyone. Oh, yes, I forgot something,

118
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:40,831
Your uncle has a bad back, it made him an ungry person

119
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:44,713
even though he had a lots of money and a large house.

120
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:50,826
He was a sour young man. He didn't become happy until he met his wife. "

121
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:56,918
Mary was curious now, she didn't think a hunchback would be married

122
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:01,802
Mrs. Medlock thought Mary was listening, so she continued her story.

123
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:05,502
Mr Craven's wife was a sweet, pretty woman,

124
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:10,024
she loves nature and she loved gardens and flowers.

125
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:13,614
Mr. Craven would have done anything for her.

126
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:16,478
No one thought she would marry a man like him.

127
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:19,656
People thought she married him for his money,

128
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:23,649
but she didn't." said Mrs. Medlock firmly.

129
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:28,950
"When she died," "Oh, Did she die?" cried Mary.

130
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,992
She thought of a child story she had read once.

131
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:37,402
The story was about a beautiful Princess and a ugly man.

132
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:40,261
She suddenly felt sorry for her uncle.

133
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:44,413
"Yes, she died," said Mrs. Medlock.

134
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:47,832
Then Mr. Craven became stranger than ever.

135
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:49,812
He won't let anyone see him.

136
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:54,675
He hates people, he won't leave his rooms,

137
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:58,227
He only has one old servants to care for him.

138
00:09:58,227 --> 00:10:02,070
Mary thought it sounded like something in a fairy tale.

139
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,270
A dark, old house with a hundred rooms.

140
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,677
A mysterious hunchback with a sad story.

141
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:14,052
She stared out the window at the rain.

142
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:16,510
England had very gray skies.

143
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:22,197
It rained a lot. In India it had always been hot and sunny.

144
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:26,562
"Don't think that you'll see your uncle. You won't.

145
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:30,241
He doesn't want to see you," said Mrs. Medlock.

146
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:33,631
"There aren't any other children at the house, either.

147
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:37,413
You'll have to play and take care of yourself.

148
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:40,240
I will show you what rooms you can enter.

149
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,541
There are many rooms you must stay away from.

150
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,815
There are gardens outside for you to play in.

151
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:51,372
But when you're in the house, you cannot wander around.

152
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:56,107
This is very important. Mr.Craven won't allow it."

153
00:10:56,107 --> 00:11:01,363
"I don't want to see his horrible house," said sour little Mary.

154
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:07,127
She stared out the window. She didn't feel sorry for Mr. Craven anymore.

155
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:11,529
He probably deserved all the bad things that happened to him.

156
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:15,893
She turned towards the window and stared at the rain.

157
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:19,993
She stared at it for so long that she fell asleep.

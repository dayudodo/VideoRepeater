CHAPTER SEVEN THE KEY TO THE GARDEN

2
00:00:04,143 --> 00:00:07,190
Two days after this, the rain ended.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,868
Mary woke up and could not believe what she saw.

4
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:13,796
The sky was the most beautiful blue!

5
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:17,644
Mary had never known that the skies could be so blue.

6
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:21,438
In India, the skies were always hot and yellow.

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:28,214
But this sky was a deep, cool, wonderful blue, like a jewel.

8
00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:30,953
There were tiny white clouds in the air.

9
00:00:30,953 --> 00:00:36,855
"It's beautiful!" cried Mary. She jumped out of bed.

10
00:00:36,855 --> 00:00:41,834
"Yes, it's nice at this time of year!" said Martha cheerfully.

11
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,162
"The blue sky reminds us that spring is coming.

12
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:48,977
It's still a long way off, but it's coming."

13
00:00:48,977 --> 00:00:54,101
"I thought it always rained and looked dark in England," said Mary.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:02,063
Martha laughed. "Oh,no! Yorkshire is the most beautiful place on earth, when the sun shines.

15
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:07,906
Wait till you see the purple and yellow flowers growing, and smell the young grass.

16
00:01:07,906 --> 00:01:12,955
You'll want to stay out on the moor forever, just like Dickon does."

17
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:16,720
"Could I ever get there?" asked Mary.

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,368
She stared out at the moor. It seemed to go on forever.

19
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:24,560
"I don't know," said Martha.

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,820
"I don't think you've ever used your legs in your life.

21
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,677
I don't think you could walk five miles.

22
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:33,716
It's five miles to my family's house."

23
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:37,618
"I would like to see your house," said Mary.

24
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:40,348
Martha stared at Mary for a moment.

25
00:01:40,348 --> 00:01:42,707
The she went on with her cleaning.

26
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:46,753
She thought that Mary's face did not look as sour as usual.

27
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:49,790
It looked like her youngest sister's face,

28
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,265
when she wanted something very much.

29
00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:55,910
"I'll ask my mother," Martha said.

30
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,129
"She almost always finds a way to do things.

31
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:02,762
It's my day off today, and I'm going home.

32
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:07,357
Oh, I am glad! Maybe mother can ask Mrs. Medlock about it.

33
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:09,953
Mrs. Medlock likes my mother."

34
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:13,504
"I like your mother, too," said Mary.

35
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:17,535
"It seems like you do!" said Martha.

36
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:23,181
"And I haven't even met her. I like Dickon, too," said Mary.

37
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:25,744
"Well, it's hard not to like Dickon.

38
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:27,923
All the animals like him.

39
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:33,193
I wonder what he would think of you," she said curiously, looking at Mary.

40
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:37,712
"He wouldn't like me," said Mary in her cold little way.

41
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:39,560
"No one does."

42
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,732
Martha looked as if she was thinking about something.

43
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:46,558
"How do you like yourself?" she finally asked.

44
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:50,860
Mary was surprised. She thought about it for a minute.

45
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,214
"I guess I don't really like myself," she said.

46
00:02:56,214 --> 00:02:58,651
"But I never thought of it before."

47
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:02,978
Martha laughed. "That's something Mother once asked me.

48
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:05,006
I've never forgotten it."

49
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:09,172
Martha left as soon as she had given Mary breakfast.

50
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:13,526
She was going to walk five miles to her family's little house.

51
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,640
There, she would help her mother with the washing.

52
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,302
She would bake bread and enjoy herself very much.

53
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:23,466
After breakfast Mary went outside.

54
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:28,420
She felt a little lonely, knowing Martha wasn't going to be there when she returned.

55
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,772
She went into the gardens as quickly as she could.

56
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:36,424
The first thing she did was to run around in circles ten times.

57
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,236
This made her feel better.

58
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:42,460
After a minute she went into one of the kitchen gardens.

59
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,212
She saw Ben Weatherstaff, the old gardener, working there.

60
00:03:47,212 --> 00:03:51,101
The fresh air and blue sky seemed to make him feel good.

61
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,804
He spoke to her.

62
00:03:52,804 --> 00:03:58,025
"Spring is coming," he said. "Can you smell it in the air?"

63
00:03:58,025 --> 00:04:04,494
Mary breathed deeply. "I smell something fresh and good," she said.

64
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:09,239
"That's the smell of the good earth, getting ready to grow things.

65
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,935
If you look into the gardens, you'll see small plants beginning to grow."

66
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:18,269
"What are they?" asked Mary.

67
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,373
"They're different kinds of flowers. Crocuses and daffodils.

68
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:27,771
Haven't you ever seen them before?" asked Ben.

69
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:31,465
"In India, we don't have flowers like that.

70
00:04:31,465 --> 00:04:34,762
And it is always hot, and wet, and green.

71
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:38,410
After it rains, things will grow very quickly."

72
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,183
"Well, they don't do that here. But you watch.

73
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:47,790
They'll get a little bigger each day," said Ben.

74
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:53,503
"Are there also flowers growing in the garden where the robin lives?" Mary asked.

75
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:58,437
Ben didn't seem to like this question. "Ask the robin!"

76
00:04:58,437 --> 00:05:02,440
he said. "He's the only one that knows,

77
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,701
No one has been inside that garden for ten years."

78
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:10,732
Mary walked away, thinking.

79
00:05:10,732 --> 00:05:15,650
She liked the mysterious garden, even though she'd never been inside it.

80
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,011
She liked the robin, too.

81
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:23,213
Also, she liked Martha, and she even liked Dickon and Martha's mother,

82
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:25,543
even though she'd never met them.

83
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:28,287
This seemed like a lot of people to like,

84
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,702
when you'd never had friends before!

85
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:33,897
Suddenly Mary heard  a bird singing.

86
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:37,537
She looked at the ground and there was the little robin!

87
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,211
He was eating worms and seeds that had fallen on the ground,

88
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:43,642
and pretending not to notice her.

89
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:46,445
But Mary knew he had been following her.

90
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:50,332
"You do remember me!" Mary cried.

91
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:53,741
"Oh, you are prettier than anything in the world!"

92
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:57,052
The robin sang and hopped along the ground.

93
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:59,808
Mary laughed and talked back to him.

94
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:05,884
The robin looked like a little person, with his tiny bright red chest and his brigth eyes.

95
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:07,986
He was beautiful.

96
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:12,833
Mary forgot she had ever been angry or unhappy in her life.

97
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,844
As Mary stood there, talking to the pretty robin,

98
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:22,042
she saw him hop over to a little place on the ground where the earth had been turned up.

99
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:26,671
It was like very small hill of dirt, under some bushes.

100
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:30,483
A dog had been digging there, looking for a rabbit.

101
00:06:30,483 --> 00:06:33,969
Mary looked at this area, without knowing why.

102
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:38,419
She saw something lying in the dirt that was a little bit shiny.

103
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:40,949
She walked over to look at it.

104
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:46,588
It was a large, old key, with a thick metal ring attached to it.

105
00:06:46,588 --> 00:06:49,442
Mary picked it up and looked at it.

106
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:54,001
She was amazed and a little bit frightened, although she didn't know why.

107
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:59,048
"Perhaps this key has been buried in the ground for ten years,"

108
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:03,866
she whispered. "Maybe it's the key to the secret garden!"

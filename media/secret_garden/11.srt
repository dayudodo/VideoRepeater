CHAPTER ELEVEN THE BIRD'S NEST

2
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:10,351
Dickon began to walk around the garden slowly and softly, like a cat.

3
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:16,381
He seemed to notice everything the gray vinces, brown trees, and stone benches.

4
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:21,535
"I never thought I'd see this place," he said at last.

5
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:27,772
Mary was shocked. "Did you know about it?" she whispered.

6
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:34,207
"Martha told me there was one garden at Misselthwaite that no one went into.

7
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:38,171
I used to wonder what it was like," he said.

8
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,690
His eyes looked happy as he explored the garden.

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,667
"There will be lots of birds' nests here, in the spring.

10
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:48,458
It's quiet and safe here."

11
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:52,120
"Oh, Dickon, will there be roses in the spring?

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,639
I mean, do all the roses look dead?" said Mary.

13
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:01,106
"Oh, no, not all of them!" he answered.

14
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:09,920
"Look at this," He took out a knife from his pocket, and cut into a very large, tall bunch of rose branches.

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,958
"Do you see how the inside looks a little green and wet?" he asked.

16
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:20,603
"That means it's alive. If the wood looks dry,

17
00:01:20,603 --> 00:01:23,716
and breaks off in your hand, it's dead.

18
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:28,372
There's a lot of dead wood in this garden that would be cut out,

19
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:31,185
but I think plenty is probably still alive."

20
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:35,836
"Do you really think so?" Mary whispered excitedly.

21
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:40,344
"I'm so glad! I want everything to be alive.

22
00:01:40,344 --> 00:01:43,338
Let's go around the garden and see!"

23
00:01:43,338 --> 00:01:46,499
Dickon was as excited as she was.

24
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:52,158
They went around the garden testing all the rose branches and bushes.

25
00:01:52,158 --> 00:01:54,958
"The weakest branches have died,

26
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,720
but the stronger ones are still alive.

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,014
If all the old wood is cut out, and everything is taken care of,

28
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:09,696
why, there will be a fountain of roses here this summer!" Dickon said.

29
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:15,360
Mary learned to tell which wood was alive, and which was dead.

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,288
Dickon showed her how to use the garden tools.

31
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:22,927
They were busy working on one rose bush when Dickon said with surprise,

32
00:02:22,927 --> 00:02:26,184
"Why, who did that there?"

33
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:32,970
He was pointing to the little space Mary had made for the little green flower shoots.

34
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,698
"I did it," said Mary.

35
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:38,480
"Those flower shoots were so little,

36
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:42,837
and they looked like they couldn't breathe with all the dead grass and weeds around."

37
00:02:42,837 --> 00:02:48,735
"Well, you did that just like a gardener!" Dickon said.

38
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:54,145
"They'll start growing quickly now. Just you wait and see."

39
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:58,310
He ran all around the garden inspecting Mary's work.

40
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,012
He took handfuls of the dark black soil and smelled it.

41
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:07,476
"There's a lot of work to be done here," he said happily.

42
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:13,227
"Oh, please- will you come again and help me do it?" Mary asked.

43
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:17,151
"I'm fatter and stronger now. I won't get tired.

44
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:23,454
I can dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell me. Do come, Dickon!"

45
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:28,587
"I'll come every day if you want me," said Dickon firmly.

46
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:34,776
"It's the most fun I ever had - waking up a secret garden!"

47
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:37,998
"If  you do help me make the garden alive I --

48
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:42,121
I don't know what I'll do," said Mary.

49
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,571
What could you do for a boy like Dickon?

50
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:47,196
"I'll tell you what you can do.

51
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:51,407
You'll get stronger and hungry as a young fox,

52
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:54,467
and learn to talk to the birds like I do.

53
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:59,794
We'll have a lot of fun," Dickon said with his wide smile.

54
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:04,796
He walked around, looking at the trees and bushes thoughtfully.

55
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:07,855
They talked about what flowers they would plant.

56
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:12,148
They agreed that they didn't want a clean, neat looking garden.

57
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:18,030
The wanted it to look wild, and natural, and filled with many kinds of flowers.

58
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:24,274
Sitting on the ground, Mary said, "Dickon, you are as nice as Martha said.

59
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:28,047
I like you, and that makes five people.

60
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:31,056
I never thought I would like five people.

61
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:34,454
When I was in India, I hated everyone."

62
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:40,405
Dickon looked just like Martha, with his round blue eyes and red cheeks.

63
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:46,164
"You only like five people?" he said cheerfully.

64
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:48,516
"Who are the other four?"

65
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:54,659
"Your mother and Matha, and the robin and Ben Weatherstaff," said Mary.

66
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:59,055
Dickon laughed so loudly that he put his hand over his mouth.

67
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:04,340
"Well, I know you think I'm a strange boy." he said.

68
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,964
"but I think you're the strangest girl I ever knew."

69
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:12,632
Then Mary did something she had never done before.

70
00:05:12,632 --> 00:05:16,868
She leaned forward and said, "Do you like me?"

71
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:23,816
"Oh, of course! I like you a lot, and so does that robin, I think!"

72
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:26,492
The robin had flown into the garden,

73
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,833
and was sitting in a tree, wathing them and singing.

74
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,597
Suddenly Mary heard a loud bell ringing.

75
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:36,059
This meant that it was time for lunch.

76
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:39,499
"Oh,no, I have to go in and eat lunch.

77
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:43,396
I'm hungry, but I don't want to go," she said.

78
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:47,671
"Run along and eat. I'll be here when you get back.

79
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:50,621
I'll give the robin a bit of my sandwich.

80
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:54,646
He'll like a bit of bread!" Dickon said.

81
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,720
Mary almost felt that Dickon was a magic person,

82
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,142
who would disappear when she left him.

83
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:03,786
He seemed too good to be true.

84
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:07,622
She slowly walked to the garden door, but then turned around.

85
00:06:07,622 --> 00:06:13,353
"Dickon, whatever happens, you never would tell anyone, would you?"

86
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:18,524
"Now, if you were a little bird, and you showed me your nest,

87
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:25,148
Do you think I'd tell anyone?" he asked. "You're as safe as a bird with me."

88
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:26,976
And Mary knew she was.

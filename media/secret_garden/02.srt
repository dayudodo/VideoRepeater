CHAPTER TWO ACROSS THE MOORS

2
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:07,863
When Mary woke up, she was hungry.

3
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:12,284
Lucky, Mrs. Medlock had a basket food with her,

4
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:17,696
they had some cold chicken, bread and butter, and some hot tea.

5
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:21,743
afterwards, Mrs. Medlock felt sleep,

6
00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:26,915
Mary stared the window and the rain, wouldn't ever stopped?

7
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:28,913
She wish she had a book tree?

8
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:32,314
Finally, she felt sleep again.

9
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:36,957
Mrs. Medlock woke her up, it was night time.

10
00:00:36,957 --> 00:00:42,338
"It's time to get up the train." she said. "We're at Swade station."

11
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:47,039
"We still get a long way to travel before we reach Misselthwaite Manor."

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,354
They found a carriage. The carriage driver and Mrs. Medlock knew each other a little.

13
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:58,576
"I see you returned," said the driver to Mrs. Medlock,"

14
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:01,147
and you brought the child with you."

15
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:04,840
"Yes, that's her." said Mrs. Medlock.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,819
"How's your wife?" "She's all right, well, let's go."

17
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:13,216
Mary and Mrs. Medlock get into the carriage.

18
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,798
Mary stared up the window into the darkness.

19
00:01:16,798 --> 00:01:19,827
She wish she could see the countryside.

20
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:23,188
She wasn't easily frightened child.

21
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:26,664
But she couldn't help wondering what was going to happen.

22
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:32,981
"What does the moor looks like? I want to see it." said Mary to Mrs. Medlock.

23
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:36,278
"Look out of the window and about ten minutes,

24
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:39,319
you'll see it then." said Mrs. Medlock.

25
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,585
"You won't see much, because it's dark, but you'll see something."

26
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:48,024
When Mary looked outside, she saw a large, open space.

27
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,156
There was long grass and hills.

28
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:53,971
The grass moved in the wind.

29
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:57,115
There were no trees or bushes.

30
00:01:57,115 --> 00:02:01,395
The wind made a strange sound as it moved through the grass.

31
00:02:01,395 --> 00:02:05,390
"Now we're on the moors," said Mrs. Medlock.

32
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,954
"The moor is many miles of wild grass land.

33
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:11,272
No trees or bushes grow here.

34
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:15,174
Nothing lives on it but wild ponies and sheep."

35
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:20,266
Mary frowned. "It's not the ocean, is it?" she asked.

36
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:23,592
"The wind makes a strange sound in the grass.

37
00:02:23,592 --> 00:02:27,457
It sounds just like water. I don't like it," she said.

38
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:31,238
"I don't like it, either," said Mrs. Medlock.

39
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:34,546
"But in spring, I suppose it's nice enough.

40
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:37,041
Plenty of people love the moors."

41
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:42,729
Finally, after about two hours they arrived at Misselthwaite Manor.

42
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,704
It was a very large, long house.

43
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:50,362
There were very large oak trees all around it.

44
00:02:50,362 --> 00:02:54,583
Pitcher, Mr. Craven's servant, met them at the door.

45
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:58,642
Mary and Mrs. Medlock had a cup of tea in the kitchen.

46
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:01,548
When they had finished Pitcher said,

47
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,686
"Mrs. Medlock, take the child to her room now.

48
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:08,039
Mr. Craven is going to London in the morning.

49
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,449
He doesn't want to see her."

50
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:15,028
"All right, Mr. Picther," said Mrs. Medlock.

51
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,760
"As long as I know what's expected of me, I'll be all right."

52
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,791
"Just make sure he's not disturbed," said Pitcher.

53
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:28,130
"Make sure he doesn't see what he doesn't want to see."

54
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:33,817
So in this strange way Mary Lennox came to live at Misselthwaite Manor.

55
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:37,534
She had never felt so unpleasant in all of her life!

CHAPTER SIX "THERE WAS SOMEONE CRYING!"

2
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:07,707
The next morning it was raining very hard.

3
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:11,508
Mary saw that she wouldn't be able to go outside that day.

4
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:16,373
"What does your family do when it rains?" she asked Martha.

5
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:21,286
"We try not to step on each other, mostly!" said Martha.

6
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:26,071
"Our house is so small, and there are fourteen of us there!

7
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:29,416
The biggest ones go and play in the cow shed.

8
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:32,028
Dickon says he doesn't mind the rain.

9
00:00:32,028 --> 00:00:34,709
He goes outside no matter what the weather.

10
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:38,103
He says he sees things in rainy weather.

11
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:40,802
Once he found a little baby fox.

12
00:00:40,802 --> 00:00:42,900
Its mother had been killed,

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,703
so Dickon brought it home.

14
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:48,947
Another time he found a little crow, almost drowned.

15
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:51,305
He brought it home and tamed it.

16
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:54,432
Now if flies around with him everywhere!"

17
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:58,204
Mary had decided that she liked Martha's stories.

18
00:00:58,204 --> 00:01:05,340
In India, Mary's Ayi had told her stories about princesses and princes, or magical things.

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,518
Martha's stories were more like real life.

20
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:13,203
Mary especially liked it when Martha talked about her mother and Dickon.

21
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:18,626
"Well, if I had an animal friend, I could play with it," said Mary,

22
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:25,699
"But I have nothing." "Can you sew?" asked Martha. "No."

23
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:31,629
"Can you read?" "Yes," said Mary. She liked reading.

24
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:36,630
"Well, why don't you ask Mrs. Medlock if you can go into the library?

25
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,286
There are thousands of books there."

26
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:44,605
This was a very good idea, Mary didn't ask Mrs. Medlock, however.

27
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:50,382
She knew that Mrs. Medlock was always in her comfortable sitting room downstairs.

28
00:01:50,382 --> 00:01:55,271
Really, in this house, one never saw anyone at all!

29
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:59,122
Mary decided to go and find the library herself.

30
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:01,596
She could explore the house.

31
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:06,142
Mary waited until Martha had gone downstairs before leaving her room.

32
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:11,055
For the next two hours Mary wandered around the enormous house.

33
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:14,299
It seemed that there really were a hundred rooms.

34
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:19,265
It was such a strange house, no one lived in these many rooms.

35
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:22,910
In one room, there was a little glass cabinet.

36
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,729
It had some small elephants inside.

37
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:30,215
They were made of stone. These reminded Mary of India.

38
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:35,398
She opened the cabinet and played with the little stone elephants for a while,

39
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:38,277
soon she began to feel tired.

40
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:43,656
she put ivory elephants back into the cabinet, the way she had found them.

41
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:46,807
She decided it was time to go back to her room.

42
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:49,674
She never had found the library!

43
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:53,866
Unfortunately, Mary didn't remember the way back.

44
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:59,651
She walked through a few halls with many doors and went up and down stairs.

45
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:01,873
Most of the doors were locked.

46
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:06,651
"I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere," she thought.

47
00:03:06,651 --> 00:03:08,785
It was so quiet!

48
00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:11,603
Mary came to the end of a passage.

49
00:03:11,603 --> 00:03:16,694
There was a beautiful, thick curtain covering hanging on the wall at the passage's end.

50
00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:20,307
"Now where do I go?" thought Mary.

51
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:25,466
It was just at this moment that she heard a sound like someone crying.

52
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:30,289
Curious, she put her hand on the curtain, and it moved.

53
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:35,783
Mary was surprised to see that the curtain covered the door, which had opened.

54
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:39,024
The passage continued on the other side.

55
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:43,965
Mary saw Mrs. Medlock walking towards her with some keys in her hand.

56
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:46,597
Suddenly she saw Mary.

57
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:50,899
"What are you doing here?" she said to Mary angrily.

58
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:54,568
"What did I tell you about wandering around the house?"

59
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:59,156
"I was going back to my room but I got lost," said Mary.

60
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,464
"Then I heard someone crying."

61
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:04,995
Mrs. Medlock looked even angrier.

62
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:09,356
"You didn't hear anyone crying!" she said.

63
00:04:09,356 --> 00:04:15,562
She pulled and pushed Mary down the hall, around the corner, and back to her own room.

64
00:04:15,562 --> 00:04:18,340
"Now, you stay where you're told to stay.

65
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,271
Otherwise, you'll be locked up.

66
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:23,352
Master Craven had better find you a teacher.

67
00:04:23,352 --> 00:04:25,595
You need someone to watch you!

68
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:28,018
I have enough to do already!"

69
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,601
Mary hated Mrs. Medlock at that moment.

70
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:36,179
She did not cry; she was only very angry.

71
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:39,080
She went and sat down by the fire.

72
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,900
"There was someone crying, there was, there was!"

73
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,615
Mary said to herself. "She's not telling the truth!"

74
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:51,462
She had heard the mysterious crying two times now.

75
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:54,733
One day, she would find out what it was.

76
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:58,850
In the meantime, she had had a very interesting day.

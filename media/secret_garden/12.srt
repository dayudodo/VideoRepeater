CHAPTER TWELVE MEETING UNCLE ARCHIBALD

2
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:08,849
Quickly Mary ran back to her rooms.

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,534
Her lunch was waiting, and Martha was there with it.

4
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:18,600
"Martha, I've seen Dickon! He brought me those garden tools and seeds!"

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,351
Mary cried as she sat down.

6
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:25,268
"I knew he'd come. What do you think of him?"

7
00:00:25,268 --> 00:00:30,559
"I think, I think he's beautiful," said Mary firmly.

8
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:36,232
Martha laughed. "Well, we always thought he was wonderful,

9
00:00:36,232 --> 00:00:38,558
but we never thought he was handsome.

10
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:41,192
His nose turns up too much."

11
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:47,767
"I don't care. I like it. I like everything about him," said Mary.

12
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:51,864
"Where are you going to plant your seeds?" asked Martha.

13
00:00:51,864 --> 00:00:57,456
Mary was nervous. She hoped Martha wouldn't ask too many questions about this!

14
00:00:57,456 --> 00:01:02,089
"Well... I haven't asked where I can plant them yet," she said.

15
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:05,780
"Well, don't ask the head gardener, Mr. Roach.

16
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,291
He's too busy. I'd ask Ben Weatherstaff, if I were you.

17
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,735
He might look cross, but he's really a nice man.

18
00:01:13,735 --> 00:01:19,804
Mr. Craven lets him do what he likes, because Ben and Mrs. Craven were very good friends.

19
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:23,353
Ben used to make her laugh, says Mr. Craven.

20
00:01:23,353 --> 00:01:27,139
Perhaps Ben can find you a little piece of land somewhere."

21
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:30,427
Mary ate her lunch as quickly as she could.

22
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:34,646
Just as she was about to put her coat and run back outside,

23
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:36,896
Mrs. Medlock entered the room.

24
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:40,933
"Martha, help the child to put on her best dress.

25
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:47,121
Mr. Craven is going away tomorrow for a long time,and he wants to see her before he goes.

26
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:50,661
I'll come back in ten minutes," she said.

27
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:54,725
She looked nervous and excited, and immediately left the room.

28
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:59,356
Mary was terrified. Why did her uncle want to see her?

29
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:01,179
What would she say to him?

30
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:05,353
Probably he would not like her, and she would not like him.

31
00:02:05,353 --> 00:02:08,219
They would sit there in silence.

32
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,058
Martha helped her to dress and brush her hair.

33
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:13,970
When Mrs. Medlock returned,

34
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,746
she took Mary to a part of the house she had never been to before.

35
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:22,603
At last Mrs. Medlock knocked on a large, strong door.

36
00:02:22,603 --> 00:02:27,321
"Come in, " Mary heard someone say, and they entered the room.

37
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:29,319
Mary was trembling.

38
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,279
"This is Miss Mary, sir." said Mrs. Medlock.

39
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:36,521
"You can leave now, Mrs. Medlock.

40
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:41,123
I will ring the bell when I want you to take her away," said the man.

41
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:43,817
Now he and Mary were alone.

42
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:47,457
Mary stood there, a thin, plain child.

43
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:49,016
She bit her lip.

44
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:52,975
She noticed that her uncle didn't have lump on his back after all.

45
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:56,261
"Basil just made that up," she thought.

46
00:02:56,261 --> 00:03:02,889
Uncle Archibald was very thin and pale, and had black hair with many white streaks.

47
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:05,695
He looked sad and tired.

48
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:08,033
"Come here," he said.

49
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:12,327
Mary went to him. His face might have been handsome,

50
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:14,959
but it was extremely unhappy.

51
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,553
He looked worried and nervous, as he stared at Mary.

52
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:23,267
At the same time, he seemed to be thinking about other things.

53
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:26,255
"Are you well?" he asked her.

54
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:29,129
"Yes," said Mary.

55
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:31,417
"Do they take care of you?"

56
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:35,909
"Yes," said Mary. She didn't know what to say.

57
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:38,945
"You are very thin," he said.

58
00:03:38,945 --> 00:03:42,301
"I forgot about you. How could I remember you?

59
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:48,985
I meant to find you a teacher or a nurse, but I forgot."

60
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:53,099
"Please," Mary began, but could not say any more.

61
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,959
She thought she might cry.

62
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,753
"What do you want to say?" asked her uncle.

63
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:01,959
"Please don't make me have a teacher just yet.

64
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,247
And I am too big for a nurse," said Mary softly.

65
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:09,321
Her uncle stared at her and looked thoughtful.

66
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:12,303
"That was what the Sowerby woman said.

67
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:14,499
I saw her in the village one day,

68
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:16,859
and she spoke to me about you."

69
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:21,227
"She is Martha's mother, isn't she?" asked Mary.

70
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,963
"She knows about children. She has twelve of them."

71
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:29,272
"What would you like to do instead?" asked her uncle.

72
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:31,525
Mary felt a little braver,

73
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:33,811
but she was still afraid of him.

74
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:38,587
"I want, I want to playoutside," she whispered.

75
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:41,589
"I am getting fatter and stronger.

76
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,885
I like it here more than in India.

77
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:46,509
There I was always sick and thin.

78
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:50,853
Here, I run around, and look to see what is growing in the gardens.

79
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:55,569
I won't make any trouble, I promise, sir," she said.

80
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:59,885
"Don't look so frightened," he said in a worried voice.

81
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:02,077
"Of course you don't make trouble.

82
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:04,091
You may do what you want."

83
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:09,795
"Can I?" Mary said. She looked him in the eyes for the first time.

84
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:11,600
"Of course you can.

85
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,562
You are only a little girl, and I am your guardian.

86
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:18,325
I am a bad guardian for a child,

87
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:23,575
because I am always sick and busy and unhappy.

88
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:28,013
But I want you to be happy and comfortable.

89
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:30,953
I don't know anything about chidlren,

90
00:05:30,953 --> 00:05:35,878
but Mrs. Medlock and Martha will make sure you have what you need.

91
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:40,751
Now that I have seen you, I think Mrs. Sowerby was right.

92
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:43,067
She was brave to speak to me,

93
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:45,485
but she said intelligent things.

94
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:48,177
Play outside as much as you like.

95
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:50,687
You may go wherever you want.

96
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:52,675
Is there anything you want?

97
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:56,002
Toys, books, or clothes?"

98
00:05:56,002 --> 00:06:00,659
"Please, sir, " said mary shyly, looking at the ground,

99
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:03,235
"Could I have a small piece of land?"

100
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:06,009
Her uncle looked very surprised.

101
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,939
"Land!" he said. "what do you mean?"

102
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:16,823
"To make a small garden - to plant things - to watch them grow," whispered Mary.

103
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:20,141
Her uncle walked slowly across the room.

104
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:24,941
He seemed to be remembering something, or thinking about something.

105
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:28,425
"Do you care about gardens so much?"

106
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:31,174
"I never knew about them in India.

107
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:34,825
In India I was too hot and tried all the time.

108
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:37,979
But there, it is different," said Mary.

109
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:41,943
Her uncle's sad eyes were kind as he looked at her.

110
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,835
"You may have as much land as you like.

111
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:50,383
You remind me of someone else who loved gardens,and things that grow.

112
00:06:50,383 --> 00:06:54,772
when you see a piece of land you want, take it, child,

113
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:56,772
and make it come alive."

114
00:06:56,772 --> 00:07:00,453
"May I take it from anywhere, if no one wants it?"

115
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:05,468
"Anywhere," he said. "Now you must go, I am tired."

116
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:08,312
He rang a bell, to call Mrs. Medlock.

117
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:11,058
When Mrs. Medlock came, he said,

118
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:17,862
"Mrs. Medlock, I have decided that the child should not begin lessons right now.

119
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:21,768
Let her play outside as much as she wants.

120
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:24,461
Give her simple, healthy food.

121
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:27,915
Don't watch her too closely," he said.

122
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,780
Mrs. Medlock was secretly happy.

123
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,551
She hadn't wanted a little girl to take care of,

124
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:36,495
and had seen Mary as little as possible.

125
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:40,971
"Thank you, sir. I understand," she said.

126
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:44,682
"Take Miss Mary away now," said Mr. Craven.

127
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:49,384
They went back to Mary's room, where Mary was left alone with Martha.

128
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:53,429
"Martha, I can have a garden!" she cried.

129
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:57,060
"And I don't have to have a teacher for a long time.

130
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,138
He spoke with your mother and she said I shouldn't.

131
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:01,903
I can do what I want.

132
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:05,370
I can go to your mother's house and she may come to see me!"

133
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:12,303
"Ah, I'm glad. That was nice of him, wasn't it?" said Martha happily.

134
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:17,076
"Martha, he really is a very nice man," said Mary seriously.

135
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:20,037
"He looks so terribly sad, though."

136
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:23,487
She ran to the secret garden as quickly as she could.

137
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:26,422
She hadn't meant to be away for so long.

138
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,559
She knew Dickon might not be there,

139
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:32,621
because he had to walk five miles back home before dark.

140
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:36,639
When she opened the garden door, no one was there.

141
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:41,080
But then she saw a little piece of paper attached to one of the trees.

142
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,601
On the paper was a picture of a bird in its nest, and these words:

143
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,373
"I will come back."

144
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:51,763
How she liked that boy! She couldn't wait for tomorrow.

CHAPTER FIVE THE STRANGE CRY

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:10,064
At first, each day at Misselthwaite Manor was exactly the same.

3
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:15,529
Mary woke up each moring and ate her breakfast in front of the fire with Martha.

4
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:19,981
She stared out of the window at the wide, brown moor.

5
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:24,112
Finally she would realize that if she didn't go outside,

6
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:26,983
she would have to stay in and do nothing.

7
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:31,845
So she went out. She did not know that this was the best thing for her.

8
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:38,737
When she began to walk or run around the gardens and paths, she was making herself stronger.

9
00:00:38,737 --> 00:00:46,638
The wind, which was very cold, fresh, and strong, put color in her cheeks and brightened her eyes.

10
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:51,147
Mary hated the wind, and she ran only to make herself warmer.

11
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:56,002
But she was becoming a little healthier, just by staying outside.

12
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:59,386
After few days of being outside all day,

13
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:04,133
Mary woke up in the moring feeling really hungry for the first time.

14
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:07,798
When she sat down to her breakfast, she ate all of it.

15
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:13,481
"You liked that this morning, didn't you?" said Martha with surprise.

16
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:17,121
"It tastes nice today," said Mary.

17
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,886
She felt a little surprised herself.

18
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:23,188
"It's the fresh air that's giving you an appetite.

19
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:26,332
You're lucky you have food, now that you're hungry.

20
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:31,710
There's twelve children in our house, who are hungry but don't have much food.

21
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,504
Keep on playing outside every day.

22
00:01:34,504 --> 00:01:38,090
You'll gain some weight and you won't be so thin and yellow."

23
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,570
"I don't play," said Mary. "I have no toys to play with."

24
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,580
"Of course you do!" said Martha.

25
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,597
"Our children only with sticks and stones.

26
00:01:50,597 --> 00:01:54,108
They just run around and shout and look at things."

27
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:58,680
Mary didn't run and shout, but she looked at things.

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,815
She walked around the gardens and the other places on the property.

29
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:05,688
Sometimes she looked for Ben Weatherstaff,

30
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:08,648
but he was often busy with his gardening work.

31
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:12,270
Either that, or he was just too cross.

32
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,973
There was one place Mary went to more often than any other.

33
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:20,258
It was a path outside the walled gardens.

34
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:22,889
There were thick vines on the walls,

35
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:27,750
Mary noticed in one area the vines were especially thick,

36
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,996
as if  no one had cut them for a long time.

37
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:34,316
A few days after she talked to Ben Weatherstaff,

38
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:38,692
Mary had noticed this. She wondered why it was.

39
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,906
Suddenly she heard the sound of a bird.

40
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:47,162
She looked up. The robin was sitting on top of the wall, looking at her.

41
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:52,624
"Oh!" she cried. "Is it you? Is it you?"

42
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:55,937
It seemed that he really understood her.

43
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:58,989
The robin hopped along the wall and sang,

44
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:01,078
as if he were talking to her.

45
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:06,236
Mary began to laugh, and run along the wall next to the little bird.

46
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:10,388
As she ran and laughed, she looked almost pretty.

47
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:15,290
"I like you! I like  you!" she cried.

48
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,677
She tried to whistle and sing like the robin.

49
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:22,141
She didn't really know how to sing like a bird.

50
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:26,351
But the robin didn't seem to mind; he sang back to her.

51
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:31,669
Suddenly the robin flew up to a tree behind one of the walls.

52
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:37,205
Mary realized that it was the same tree she had seen the day she met Ben Weatherstaff.

53
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:40,485
It was the tree behind the mysterious wall.

54
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:45,708
"That tree is in the garden no one can enter," Mary said.

55
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,824
"The robin lives in the garden without a door.

56
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:51,712
I wish I could go inside and see it!"

57
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:56,281
For a moment, Mary watched the robin sitting in the tree.

58
00:03:56,281 --> 00:03:59,254
Then she ran all around the walls.

59
00:03:59,254 --> 00:04:04,972
She ran through the orchard gardens and felt along the walls, looking for a door.

60
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:06,764
but she couldn't find one.

61
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:11,589
"It really seems as if there is no door," said Mary out loud.

62
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:14,122
"But there was a door ten years ago,

63
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:17,950
because Martha said that Mr. Craven threw away the key."

64
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,807
the mystery of the garden gave Mary something to think about.

65
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:26,201
She began to feel glad that she had come to Misselthwaite Manor.

66
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:31,484
In India, she had always been too hot and bored to care about things.

67
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:35,225
But now that she was outside in the fresh, cold air,

68
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:38,347
her  mind and body felt a little better.

69
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:41,235
Mary stayed outside all day.

70
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:45,708
When she went inside, she felt hungry and tired, but good.

71
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:50,325
She sat down to eat dinner, and ate everything on her plate.

72
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:53,545
She did not feel angry when Martha talked to her.

73
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:56,585
Mary felt it was nice to hear her talk.

74
00:04:56,585 --> 00:05:01,376
"Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?" Mary asked her.

75
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:05,029
She had finished dinner and was sitting by the fireplace.

76
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:11,435
Martha smiled. "Are you still thinking about that garden?" she asked.

77
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:16,535
"I knew you would. I was the same way, when I first arrived here."

78
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:19,286
She sat down and made herself comfortable.

79
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:22,610
"Now listen," Martha said.

80
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,802
"Mrs. Medlock said that we cannot talk about it.

81
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:31,293
There are a lot of secrets in this house; lots of things we can't talk about.

82
00:05:31,293 --> 00:05:33,828
That's Mr. Craven's orders.

83
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:37,261
He doesn't want servants talking about his problems.

84
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:42,513
The truth is that Mr. Craven wouldn't be like he is today, if it wasn't for that garden.

85
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:45,421
 The garden was Mrs. Craven's.

86
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:49,226
She had the garden made, and she loved it.

87
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:54,830
She and Mr. Craven used to go into the garden, shut the door, and not come out for hours.

88
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,278
Well, in the garden there was a rose tree with a branch that looked just like a chair.

89
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:03,556
Mrs. Craven liked to sit in this tree and read.

90
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:08,291
One day, she was sitting there and the branch broke, and she fell.

91
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:12,603
She was hurt very badly, and the next day she died.

92
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:16,646
The doctors thought Mr. Craven would go crazy and die too.

93
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:20,047
His wife was the only person he had ever loved.

94
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,335
That's why he hates the garden.

95
00:06:22,335 --> 00:06:24,766
He shut the door and locked it.

96
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:27,248
The he threw away the key."

97
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:30,224
Mary didn't ask any more questions.

98
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,849
At that moment, a good thing was happening to her.

99
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:36,598
She was thinking about this sad story,

100
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:40,660
and she realized that she did feel sorry for her uncle.

101
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,603
He hadn't had a very happy life.

102
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,864
The wind was very loud,

103
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:50,474
but suddenly Mary thought that she heard something else, besides the wind.

104
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:53,724
It sounded just like a child crying.

105
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:58,237
Mary knew that sometimes the wind made a sound like someone crying.

106
00:06:58,237 --> 00:07:00,609
But as she listened to the sound,

107
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:05,001
she felt sure that it came from inside the house, not outside.

108
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:09,721
"Do you hear anyone crying?" Mary asked Martha.

109
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:15,941
Martha looked uncomfortable. "It's just the wind," she said.

110
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:19,511
"The wind makes that sound. It's nothing."

111
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:22,960
Someone must have left a window open in the house.

112
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,699
But at that moment, the door to Mary's sitting room opened with a loud noise.

113
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,475
Mary could hear the crying quite loudly now.

114
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:35,096
It sounded just like a child!

115
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:39,285
"There! Don't you hear it?" she said.

116
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:45,069
Martha ran to close the door. "It was the wind," she said.

117
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:48,090
"Or maybe it's Betty, one of the maids.

118
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,553
She's had a toothache all day." She didn't look at Mary.

119
00:07:52,553 --> 00:07:58,047
Mary stared at Martha. She did not believe that she was telling the truth.

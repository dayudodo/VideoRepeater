CHAPTER FOUR THE ROBIN AND THE GARDENER

2
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:08,360
So Mary put on her coat and went outside.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,845
The skies were gray, and it was cold.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:18,715
She could not help thinking about the mysterious locked garden that no one had seen for ten years.

5
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:23,684
She wondered what it looked like, and if there were flowers in it.

6
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:26,614
Why was the door to the garden locked?

7
00:00:26,614 --> 00:00:29,525
You could always walk into a garden.

8
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:34,120
Mary saw that she was near some gardens, and headed towards them.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,282
Maybe the locked garden was nearby.

10
00:00:37,282 --> 00:00:40,442
Mary walked through several gardens.

11
00:00:40,442 --> 00:00:44,318
They had trees and paths and fountains.

12
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:48,800
Eveything was brown and looked dead, because it was winter.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,896
Soon Mary saw a wall with vines growing on it.

14
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:56,150
Was this the wall of the locked garden?

15
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,811
No, there was a green door in the wall, and it was open.

16
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,160
Mary walked through the door.

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,465
She saw an old man in the garden, which had fruit trees.

18
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:11,758
He had some gardening tools with him.

19
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:16,932
He seemed surprised to see Mary, but nodded his head in a greeting.

20
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:19,796
He had a cross-looking face,

21
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:23,245
and did not seem very happy to see another person.

22
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:26,765
"What is this place?" asked Mary.

23
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:31,006
"It's one of the kitchen gardens," said the old man.

24
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:35,373
Mary saw that there was another green door in an opposite wall.

25
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:38,883
"Where does that door lead to?" she asked.

26
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:42,043
"Another one of the kitchen gardens."

27
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:44,210
"Can I look into it?"

28
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,042
"If you like. But there's nothing to see," said the man.

29
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,821
Mary went into the second green door.

30
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:55,213
This garden had walls around it, also.

31
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:58,812
There were winter vegetables growing out of the ground,

32
00:01:58,812 --> 00:02:01,535
such as potatoes and carrots.

33
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,107
Mary saw another green door.

34
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:06,517
She hoped the door would not open,

35
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:10,340
because that would mean she had found the mysterious garden.

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,343
But the door opened immediately.

37
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:16,472
Mary went into the third walled garden,

38
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:19,443
which was an orchard with many fruit trees.

39
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:24,451
She looked around for another door. There was none.

40
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:27,891
Mary looked at one corner of the orchard's wall.

41
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:32,073
She saw the top of the trees on the otherside of the wall.

42
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:36,630
It was as if there was another garden on the other side.

43
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,342
Was it the mysterious garden?

44
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:42,072
What was on the other side of the wall?

45
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:44,338
Where was the door?

46
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:49,212
Suddenly Mary heard the sweet sound of a bird singing.

47
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:52,052
The bird was sitting on the tree tops,

48
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:55,123
in the area on the other side of the orchard.

49
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:59,853
It was almost as if he had seen Mary, and was calling to her.

50
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:04,734
The bird had a little brown body and a bright red chest.

51
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:07,035
His song was pretty.

52
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:12,883
Mary listened to him sing, and his cheerful song gave her a nice feeling.

53
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:17,305
Even a sour, unpleasant little girl can be lonely.

54
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:23,997
The strange, walled gardens, the quiet house, and the wide grasslands made Mary feel

55
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:27,525
as if there was no one in the world but herself.

56
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:32,356
The bird's happy little song brought a look to Mary's face.

57
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:37,854
It was almost a smile. Soon the bird flew away.

58
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:44,000
"Perhaps he lives in the mysterious garden, and knows all about it," Mary thought.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,789
Mary walked back through the green doors to the first kitchen garden,

60
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:50,573
where the old man was working.

61
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:55,243
She stood watching him, in her strange unfriendly way.

62
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:59,044
"I have been into the other gardens," she said.

63
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:02,913
"There was nothing to stop you," said the man.

64
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:05,269
"I went into the orchard."

65
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:12,024
"Well, there was no dog at the door to bite you, was there?" said the man.

66
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:14,488
He didn't seem to went to walk.

67
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:19,579
"In the orchard, there was no door to the other garden," said Mary.

68
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:25,609
"What garden?" said the man in a louder voice. He looked uncomfortable.

69
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:29,657
"The one one the other side of the orchard wall," said Mary.

70
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:32,815
"There are trees there - I saw their tops.

71
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:36,157
There was a bird sitting on one of the trees and he sang.

72
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:38,026
He had a red chest."

73
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:42,031
To Mary's surprise, the man suddenly smiled.

74
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:46,457
The smile changed his cross, angry old face.

75
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:51,574
It made Mary think how much nicer a person looked, when he smiled.

76
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:54,037
This was a new thought for her.

77
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:57,007
The man turned around and whistled.

78
00:04:57,007 --> 00:05:03,756
It was soft, low sound. The next moment, a wonderful thing happened.

79
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:08,099
The little brown and red bird flew through the air,

80
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,677
and landed in the dirt near the gardener's foot!

81
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:15,565
"Here he is," said the old man.

82
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,607
Then he spoke to the bird as if he was speaking to a child.

83
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:22,668
"Where have you been, you little beggar?

84
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:25,767
I haven't seen you before today.

85
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:30,523
Have you been searching for a wife, this early in the year?

86
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:32,895
You're too bold!"

87
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:37,794
The little bird looked at the old man with his bright black eyes.

88
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:42,562
He hopped around, searching for seeds and insects in the dirt.

89
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:46,177
He didn't seem to be afraid of them at all.

90
00:05:46,177 --> 00:05:51,257
It gave Mary a strange feeling in her heart, to look at him.

91
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:56,554
The bird was so pretty and cheerful, and seemed like a person.

92
00:05:56,554 --> 00:06:01,469
He had a little fat body, and thin, delicate legs.

93
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:06,149
"Does he always come when you call him?" asked Mary.

94
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:10,623
"Yes. I've known him ever since he was little.

95
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:14,312
He came out of the nest in the other garden.

96
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:17,150
He first flew over the wall,

97
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,961
but he was too small and weak to fly back for the next few days.

98
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:30,447
So we became friends. Then when he flew back, all his family had gone.

99
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:33,764
He was lonely and came back to me."

100
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:37,738
"What kind of a bird is he?" asked Mary.

101
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:42,779
"Don't you know? He's a robin redbreast.

102
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,210
They're the friendliest birds in the world.

103
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,619
They're almost as friendly as dogs, if you know how to treat them.

104
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:54,827
Watch him hopping in the dirt, and looking at us.

105
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:57,551
He knows we're talking about him."

106
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:03,055
It was a very strange thing, to see the old man and the robin redbreast.

107
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,599
The man looked at the bird as if he was pround of him.

108
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:10,437
"He's a vain one," said the man, smiling.

109
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:14,599
"He likes to hear us talk about him. and He's curious!

110
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:18,145
He's always coming to see what I'm planting.

111
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:25,735
The bird know a lot of things -- things Mr. Craven doesn't bother to discover.

112
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:29,567
He's the real head gardener, he is!"

113
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:32,749
Mary watched the robin hop around.

114
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:37,189
It seemed that his bright black eyes looked at her curiously.

115
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:40,405
Mary wondered what he was thinking.

116
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:44,209
The strange feeling in her heart became stronger.

117
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:48,314
"Where did the rest of the robins go?" she asked.

118
00:07:48,314 --> 00:07:55,412
"I don't know. But this one stayed. He knew he'd be lonely without a friend."

119
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:58,635
Mary stepped a little closer to the robin.

120
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:00,683
She looked at the bird closely.

121
00:08:00,683 --> 00:08:05,646
She realized something. "I'm lonely," she said.

122
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:13,383
Mary had not known until now that loneliness was what had made her feel angry and cross her whole life.

123
00:08:13,383 --> 00:08:19,389
She didn't discover this important fact until she met the old man and the robin.

124
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:22,546
The old man looked carefully at Mary.

125
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:26,487
"Are you the little girl from India?" he asked.

126
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:28,751
Mary nodded her head.

127
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:31,951
"Then it's no surprise you're lonely.

128
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:35,363
This is a lonely place," he said.

129
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:42,112
He began to dig again, while the little robin hopped around, looking busy and happy.

130
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:46,105
"What is your name?" Mary asked the old man.

131
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:51,501
"Ben Weatherstaff," he said. He laughed a little.

132
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:55,868
"I'm lonely myself, except when the robin is with me.

133
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,227
He's the only friend I've got."

134
00:08:58,227 --> 00:09:01,577
"I have no friends at all," said Mary.

135
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:06,615
"I've never had any. In India, my Ayi didn't like me,

136
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:09,119
and I never played with anyone.

137
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,169
People never like me, and I never like people."

138
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:18,715
It is the custom of the Yorkshire people of England to say exactly what they think.

139
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:21,965
Ben Weatherstaff was a Yorkshire man.

140
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:25,773
"You and me are a lot alike," he said.

141
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:31,473
"We're not good-looking, and we're both as sour and angry as we look.

142
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:35,577
We've got the same nasty tempers, I think!"

143
00:09:35,577 --> 00:09:40,845
This was fact, and Mary had never heard the truth about herself.

144
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:45,706
In India, the servants always agreed with and obeyed you,whatever you did.

145
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:48,810
Mary had never thought much about her looks,

146
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,723
but she wondered if she was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff said.

147
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:56,833
She wondered if she really was "nasty".

148
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,540
She began to feel uncomfortable.

149
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,857
Suddenly the robin flew up to the top of a wall.

150
00:10:03,857 --> 00:10:05,915
He sang a little song.

151
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:10,222
Ben Weatherstaff laughed. "He wants to be friends with you!"

152
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:13,176
he said. "I think he likes you."

153
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:18,477
"He likes me?" said Mary. She looked up at the robin.

154
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:22,149
"Whould you make friends with me?" she said.

155
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:27,516
Her voice was not hard. It was as soft and eager as a little girl's can be.

156
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:30,687
Ben Weatherstaff looked at her in surprise.

157
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:36,409
"Why, you said that as nicely as if you were a real child,

158
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:45,424
instead of a sharp old woman! You said it almost like Dickon talks to his wild animal friends."

159
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:50,729
Mary turned around quickly. "Do you know Dickon, too?" she asked.

160
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:56,662
"Everyone know Dickon. He's a good boy --one of the best.

161
00:10:56,662 --> 00:11:01,361
He's always wandering around the moor. The aniamls trust him."

162
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,831
Mary wanted to ask old Ben more about Dickon,

163
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,516
but just then the robin flew away.

164
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:12,255
He had visited them for a while, but now he had other things to do.

165
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:17,150
"He is flying back over the orchard -- into the garden that has no door!"

166
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,366
cried Mary, watching the bird.

167
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:22,965
"He lives there," said Ben Weatherstaff.

168
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:25,021
"He's making his nest there.

169
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:29,042
He's probably making friends with some little girl robin,

170
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:32,378
who lives in the old rose trees."

171
00:11:32,378 --> 00:11:36,544
"Are there rose trees there?" asked Mary.

172
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:40,888
"There used to be, ten years ago," said Ben.

173
00:11:40,888 --> 00:11:43,601
He looked uncomfortable again.

174
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:46,570
"I want to see them," said Mary.

175
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,046
"Where is the green door to that garden?

176
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:51,284
It must be there somewhere."

177
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:56,132
"There was a door ten years ago, but there isn't now,"

178
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:01,871
Ben said firmly. He looked as unfriendly as he had when she first met him.

179
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:05,760
"But there must be a door!" cried Mary.

180
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,880
"There's no door that anyone can find.

181
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,418
And it's none of your business," he said.

182
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:18,064
"Don't be a troublesome child, prying into the affairs of others.

183
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:20,262
I must go on with my work.

184
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:25,129
Go away and play somewhere, I have no more time."

185
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:28,924
Ben Weatherstaff picked up his tools, and walked away.

186
00:12:28,924 --> 00:12:30,758
He did not say goodbye.

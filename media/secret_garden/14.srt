CHAPTER FOURTEEN AN INDIAN PRINCE

2
00:00:04,336 --> 00:00:07,883
During the next week it was cold and rainy.

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,156
Mary didn't like this at all,

4
00:00:10,156 --> 00:00:14,378
because there was no change to see the secret garden or Dickon.

5
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:18,579
However, she was able to spend time with Colin.

6
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:22,839
She didn't enjoy this quite as much as being in the garden with Dickon.

7
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:25,597
But she wanted to know her cousin better.

8
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:30,456
Colin had many picture books, and they read them while having tea.

9
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:34,091
Mary told Colin about Dickon and his animals,

10
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:37,201
and about the family's life in the cottage.

11
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:42,104
Colin liked hearing about these things; they were real life.

12
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:46,190
Mary was always careful when she spoke of the secret garden.

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:52,694
She needed to know if Colin was the kind of boy who could keep a secret, like Dickon.

14
00:00:52,694 --> 00:00:59,520
She wasn't sure yet. And, if Colin could be trusted with the secret, what then?

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,042
Was there a way to take Colin into the garden, without anyone else finding out?

16
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:09,264
Mrs. Medlock, Martha, and Colin's doctor were shocked

17
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:14,637
when they discovered Mary and Colin together the afternoon after they'd first met.

18
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:20,418
"Well, my boy, I don't know if Miss Mary should be here.

19
00:01:20,418 --> 00:01:26,176
Too much excitement is not good for your health," said the doctor to Colin.

20
00:01:26,176 --> 00:01:28,916
Colin began to look angry.

21
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:34,310
"I will be very excited if she leaves," he said loudly.

22
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,950
"She will stay. She makes me better. She will come and see me every day."

23
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,406
Mary thought to herself that Colin was like an Indian prince.

24
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:48,680
He told people want to do, and they did it.

25
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:53,564
The servants were afraid that if Colin got angry and became ill

26
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:55,199
They'll lose their jobs.

27
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:59,531
but stubborn little Mary was not afraid to be a Indian Prince.

28
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:04,789
Ha, if Colin gets ungry at me, I'll never go see him again.

29
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:07,219
She thought to herself.

30
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:10,029
Finally,  the rain stopped.

31
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,599
Mary woke up very early.

32
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,363
The sky was soft pinky blue,

33
00:02:15,363 --> 00:02:17,727
and no one else was awaken.

34
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:19,985
Spring was here.

35
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:23,636
The warm sun would make the flowers grown in the garden.

36
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:30,815
"I can't wait. I'm going to see the garden before breakfast." Thought Mary.

37
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:34,251
She got dress quickly and ran outside.

38
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:39,286
When she enter the garden, she was surprised and happy to see that Dickon was there.

39
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:42,427
and he brought some animals with him.

40
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:48,056
That was a large black bird, a squirrel and a little fox.

41
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:52,608
They were sitting in the garden, watching Dickon, who was busy working.

42
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:55,869
"Dickon," cried Mary.

43
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:58,790
"How could you get here so early?

44
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,697
Why, the sun is just come up."

45
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:07,367
Dickon laughed, "How can I stay away?" he said.

46
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:13,616
"The air was so fresh, and the fields was so green and the life

47
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:15,882
I couldn't stay in bed.

48
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:19,707
I run over here, shouting and singing.

49
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:21,683
The garden was waiting.

50
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:27,346
"Dickon, I'm so happy I can hardly breath!" said Mary.

51
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:31,588
All around her small flower shoots were beginning to come up.

52
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:35,201
Little green plant were poking out of the ground.

53
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:37,917
Soon they becoming flowers,

54
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:41,926
Dickon showed her some flowers that had already bloomed.

55
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:44,038
They would called crocuses.

56
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:46,330
and they were purple and gold.

57
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,666
The crocuses look so little and pretty that Mary wanted to kiss them.

58
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,984
Mary and Dickon work for hours that morning.

59
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,881
Dickon showed her the rose bushes and the vines.

60
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:01,236
They were looking much better.

61
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:04,919
Mary could see the wonderful green bumps in the wood,

62
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,328
which meant that the plant was alive and would grow roses.

63
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:13,345
They dug and pulled weeds and laughed so much

64
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:17,034
that Mary's cheeks were almost as red as Dickon's.

65
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:19,717
They discoverd something wonderful.

66
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:24,279
Ben Weatherstaff's robin was building a nest in the garden.

67
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:27,942
"We musn't bother him," whispered Dickon.

68
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:30,444
"He's found some lady robin.

69
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:34,844
He's very busy now, and won't want to talk to us.

70
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:41,392
We've got to be quiet and pretend we don't notice him, or he'll leave."

71
00:04:41,392 --> 00:04:46,344
"Let's not talk about him, or I'll look at him," whispered Mary.

72
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:48,352
"I wanted to tell you something.

73
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:50,460
Do you know about Colin?"

74
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,777
Dickon looked at her. "What do you know about him?" he said quietly.

75
00:04:55,777 --> 00:05:01,009
"I've seen him. I've talked to him every day this week," said Mary.

76
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,706
"He says it makes him feel better.

77
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:07,757
He doesn't think about being sick and drying when I'm there."

78
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:12,319
"I'm happy about that," said Dickon seriously.

79
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,475
"It makes me feel better.

80
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:20,131
I knew I couldn't say anything about that poor boy, and I didn't like it."

81
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:24,887
"How did you know about Colin?" asked Mary.

82
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:30,839
"Well, everyone around here knew Master Craven had a little boy,

83
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:36,530
who would probably die young, or be a cripple.

84
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,750
We knew Master Craven didn't want us to talk about him.

85
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,745
Everyone's so sorry for Master Craven,

86
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:52,528
because poor Mrs. Craven was such a beautiful young lady and they loved each other.

87
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:58,892
Mr.s Medlock's friends with mother, and she visits our house whenever she's nearby.

88
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:02,625
She's talked to mother about Master Colin before.

89
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:07,656
Mr.s Medlock doesn't mind us children knowing about him.

90
00:06:07,656 --> 00:06:09,812
We wouldn't ever tell."

91
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:13,862
Mary told Dickon the story of the night she'd met Colin.

92
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:16,788
"His eyes are so big, Dickon!

93
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:19,222
They're so large and gray.

94
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:24,502
And his face is so white; I thought he was a ghost at first."

95
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:27,994
"Those eyes are just like his mother's, they say,"

96
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:35,800
Dickon said. "They say Master Craven doesn't want to see Master Colin when he's awake,

97
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,358
because his eyes are so like his mother's.

98
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:43,596
But they look so different in the boy's miserable face."

99
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:47,882
"Do you think he wants to die?" whispered Mary.

100
00:06:47,882 --> 00:06:53,997
"No, but he wishes he'd never been born," said Dickon sadly.

101
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:58,218
"Mother says that's the worst feeling in the world.

102
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:02,313
Children who aren't wanted don't really live.

103
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:07,146
Master Craven would buy the boy anthing in the world,

104
00:07:07,146 --> 00:07:10,334
but he wants to forget he exists.

105
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:16,084
Master Craven's afraid that one day, Colin will be a hunchback."

106
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:19,380
"Colin's afraid of that himself.

107
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,486
He won't even sit up," said Mary.

108
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:27,507
"He says that if he feels a lump growing on his back,

109
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:31,169
he'll go crazy and scream himself to death."

110
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:34,663
"Oh, he shouldn't think things like that.

111
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:40,977
No one could get well who thought that way!" said Dickon, looking scared.

112
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:47,003
He bent down and stroked the little fox,who was sitting next to them.

113
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:53,940
After a moment he said, "Do you see anything different about the garden?

114
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,610
It's looking greener.

115
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,171
It looks more alive, now that we're taking care of it."

116
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:02,741
Mary saw that it was true.

117
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:06,279
The rose vines didn't look so brown and dry.

118
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,037
They looked alive.

119
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:13,075
"It will be greener and greener, until the brown is gone!"

120
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:21,002
"That's right. Do you know, I wonder if Master Colin would like to be out here?

121
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:28,367
If he was with us, watching the flowers grow, he wouldn't have time to think about dying.

122
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:36,224
He'd be healthier. It would be better than any doctor's medicine!" said Dickon.

123
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:40,884
"I've been thinking the same thing," said Mary.

124
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:43,887
"If Colin could keep the garden a secret,

125
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:47,645
maybe you could push his chair and we could bring him here.

126
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:51,313
The doctor said he should have fresh air, after all.

127
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:54,318
Colin doesn't want people to see him.

128
00:08:54,318 --> 00:08:58,048
He could order the gardeners to stay away from us.

129
00:08:58,048 --> 00:09:00,867
Then no one would see where we went."

130
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:06,885
"He loves to hear me talk about the garden, because it's a secret," said Mary.

131
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:11,658
"I don't tell him much, but he said he wanted to see it some day."

132
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:15,841
"We'll bring him out soon," said Dickon.

133
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:21,479
"Now look! The robin and his lady are building their nest."

134
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:24,627
They had a lot of work to do that morning.

135
00:09:24,627 --> 00:09:27,376
Mary was a little late for lunch.

136
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:33,181
She was in such a hurry to return to the garden that she'd forgotten about Colin.

137
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:37,093
"Martha, tell Colin I can't come and see him yet.

138
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:42,128
Dickon and I are very busy working on our garden," said Mary.

139
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:49,235
Martha looked frightend. "Ah, Miss Mary! It may make him angry when I tell him that."

140
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:53,769
But Mary wasn't afraid of Colin, like everyone else.

141
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:57,179
She also wasn't a very sensitive little girl.

142
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,459
Now, it is true that she was becoming kinder and nicer.

143
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:05,683
But she was still similar to the old Mary Lennox.

144
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:11,382
"I can't stay," she said. "Dickon's waiting for me."

145
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:14,732
The afternoon was even better than the morning.

146
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:19,305
Already, almost all the weeds had been removed.

147
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:23,700
Most of the roses and trees had been taken care of.

148
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,546
Dickon had taught Mary to use all her tools.

149
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:31,324
It was clear that before spring time was through,

150
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:35,285
the garden would be filled with beautiful growing things.

151
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:38,151
There would be apple and cherry trees,

152
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:41,303
and the grass would have hundreds of flowers.

153
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:45,416
The robin and his mate flew through the air singing.

154
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:49,593
The sun was setting when Mary and Dickon said goodbye.

155
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:56,279
"I'll be at work by dawn," said Dickon. "So will I!" said Mary.

156
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,091
Mary ran back to the house.

157
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:04,961
She wanted to tell Colin all about Dickon's animals,and about the spring time.

158
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:07,709
She thought he would enjoy this.

159
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:12,577
So it wasn't very pleasant when Mary found Martha waiting for her.

160
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:15,088
She had a serious face.

161
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:20,056
"What's wrong?" asked Mary. "How's Colin?"

162
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:23,782
"Oh, Miss Mary, I wish you'd gone to him.

163
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:29,097
He was really angry. It's been hard to keep him quiet all afternoon.

164
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:32,061
He's been watching the clock and waiting for you!"

165
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:35,166
Mary's little face looked sour.

166
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:39,799
Just like Colin, she wasn't used to thinking of other people.

167
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:45,233
She saw no reason why Colin should prevent her from doing what she wanted to do.

168
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:49,330
Mary had done the same thing in India, however.

169
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:55,819
There, when she'd been sick she had made everyone around her miserable just because she was.

170
00:11:55,819 --> 00:12:03,651
At the time, Mary felt she was right, but now, of course, she felt Colin was wrong!

171
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:08,476
When Mary went into Colin's room he was lying in his bed.

172
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:13,269
He didn't turn and look at her when she came in. She went over to him.

173
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,686
"Why didn't you get up?" she asked.

174
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:20,988
"I did get up this morning, when I thought you were coming.

175
00:12:20,988 --> 00:12:25,273
My back hurt and my head hurt and I was tired.

176
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:27,547
Why didn't you come?"

177
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:31,890
"I was working with Dickon in the garden," said Mary.

178
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:38,742
"I won't let that boy come here, if you go and stay with him instead of me," said Colin.

179
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:41,797
Mary really got angry then.

180
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:45,361
She could get angry without shouting, or speaking.

181
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:50,274
She just got quiet and stubborn and didn't care about anything.

182
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:56,206
"If you send Dickon away from here, I'll not come to see you again!" she said.

183
00:12:56,206 --> 00:13:00,077
"I'll have you when I want you!" said Colin.

184
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:05,724
"Oh, is that so, little Indian prince!" said Mary angrily.

185
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:08,061
"Well, you can make me come in here,

186
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:12,923
but you can't make me speak. I'll sit here and won't say a word.

187
00:13:12,923 --> 00:13:15,165
I'll look at the floor!"

188
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:17,706
They looked at each other angrily.

189
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:20,877
"You're mean!" cried Colin.

190
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:24,606
"You're just saying that because I won't do what you want.

191
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:27,976
You're meaner than I am!" said Mary.

192
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:36,917
"I'm not! I'm sick, and I'm sure there is a lump growing on myback," Colin said.

193
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:42,377
He was feeling very sorry for himself. "And I'm going to die!"

194
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:46,204
"NO, you are not!" said Mary angrily.

195
00:13:46,204 --> 00:13:51,475
Colin was extremely angry, but also a little bit pleased.

196
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:55,307
No one ever told him he would live before.

197
00:13:55,307 --> 00:14:00,712
"Yes, I am! You know I am! That's why you're mean.

198
00:14:00,712 --> 00:14:09,041
I'm going to die and you go outside all day, instead of coming to talk to me," he said.

199
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:13,917
"I don't believe it," said Mary in a hard little voice.

200
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:18,002
"You just say that so people will feel sorry for you.

201
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:20,263
Well, I don't!"

202
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:23,968
"Get out of this room!" shouted Colin.

203
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:28,764
He tried to throw a pillow at Mary, but he wasn't strong enough.

204
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:31,541
"I'm going, " said Mary.

205
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,582
"And I won't come back.

206
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:37,346
I was going to tell you about all the things I did today.

207
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:39,849
But now I won't!"

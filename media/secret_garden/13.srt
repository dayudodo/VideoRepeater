CHAPTER THIRTEEN COLIN

2
00:00:03,756 --> 00:00:07,394
You never know what the weather will be like in England.

3
00:00:07,394 --> 00:00:11,287
Mary woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of rain.

4
00:00:11,287 --> 00:00:13,297
She laid in bed and thougth,

5
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:16,806
"Oh, the rain came because it knew I didn't want it!

6
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:19,375
I hope it stops by morning."

7
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:24,675
Mary laid in bed and listened to the sound of the rain and the wind on the moors.

8
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:26,720
She couldn't go back to sleep.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,083
How loud the wind was!

10
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:34,887
"The wind sounds just like someone lost outside and crying," she thought.

11
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:40,568
She had been lying in bed awake for one hour,when something made her sit up.

12
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:42,406
 She listened carefully.

13
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:45,752
"It isn't the wind," she said to herself.

14
00:00:45,752 --> 00:00:51,453
"I do hear someone crying. It's the same sound as before!"

15
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:54,652
Mary got out of bed and opened her door.

16
00:00:54,652 --> 00:00:56,858
She looked up and down the hall.

17
00:00:56,858 --> 00:01:00,630
She felt she had to solve the mystery of the crying.

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,519
It seemed even stranger to her than the secret garden.

19
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,210
"I am going to find out what it is," she said.

20
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:14,489
"Everyone is in bed and I don't care what Mrs. Medlock says, I don't care!"

21
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,020
Mary found a candle in her room, and lit it.

22
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,918
Softly she walked down the hall towards the noise.

23
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:26,977
She knew she had to find the beautiful curtain, with the door behind it.

24
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:30,782
That was where she'd heard the crying sound before.

25
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:33,688
She tried to follow the sound of the crying.

26
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:38,507
Sometimes the crying stopped, but it always started again.

27
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:41,479
Mary was able to remember her path,

28
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,313
and she was standing in front of the beautiful curtain.

29
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:49,212
She pushed it aside, and opened the door behind it.

30
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:52,461
Now she was standing in a short passage.

31
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:57,335
She could hear the crying very clearly now, but it wasn't loud.

32
00:01:57,335 --> 00:02:00,369
It was coming from behind one of the walls.

33
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:04,272
Mary saw a door a few feet down the passage.

34
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:08,001
Taking a deep breath, she opened the door.

35
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,033
What would she find?

36
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:16,360
She saw a large, beautiful room. In the middle of the room there was a bed,

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,825
and on the bed a boy lay.

38
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:23,492
He looked about her age,and he was crying unhappily.

39
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:29,597
Mary wondered if she was dreaming. She hadn't expected to find another child!

40
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:37,098
The boy had a small, white face, thick dark hair, and enormous gray eyes.

41
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:42,702
He looked like he'd been sick, but he was crying as if he was only tired.

42
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:45,590
Now he stared at Mary.

43
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:52,650
"Who are you?" he whispered. He looked very scared. "Are you a ghost?"

44
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:59,091
Mary was just as frightened. "No, I'm not. Are you?"

45
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:05,727
He stared at her. His gray eyes were so big that they made his face look smaller.

46
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:13,387
"No," he said finally. "I am Colin." "Who is Colin?" Mary asked.

47
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:17,385
"I am Colin Craven. Who are you?"

48
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:22,746
"I'm Mary Lennox. Mr. Craven is my uncle," said Mary.

49
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:26,028
"He's my father," said the boy.

50
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:33,995
Mary was shocked. "He's your father? But, why didn't they tell me he had a son?"

51
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:39,071
Colin didn't answer her immediately. "Come here," he said.

52
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:45,063
Mary walked over to the bed. Colin put out his hand and touched her sleeping gown.

53
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:51,157
"You are real, aren't you?" he said. "I think you could be a dream."

54
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:59,315
"I'm not a dream," said Mary. "Here, touch my hand. That feels real, doesn't it?

55
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:03,949
When I came in here, I thought you might be a dream, too."

56
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:06,214
"Where did you come from?"

57
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:11,261
"From my room. I woke up and couldn't go back to sleep.

58
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:15,915
I heard someone crying, and I wanted to see who it was.

59
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:18,199
Why were you crying?"

60
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,912
"Because I couldn't go to sleep either, and my head hurts.

61
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:25,846
What is your name again?"

62
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:31,380
"Mary Lennox. So no one told you I had come to live here?"

63
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:37,184
"No. They would never do that. I would have been afraid you would see me.

64
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:41,244
I won't let people see me and talk about me."

65
00:04:41,244 --> 00:04:45,331
Mary was confused. "But why not?"

66
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:50,127
"Because I am always sick like this, and have to stay in bed.

67
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:55,618
I don't even walk, because I have to take care of  my back.

68
00:04:55,618 --> 00:05:01,207
It may end up like my father's back, all bent and crooked.

69
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:06,703
My father doesn't want anyone to know about me except the servants.

70
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:09,965
No one is allowed to talk about me.

71
00:05:09,965 --> 00:05:15,321
If I live, I might be a hunchback, but I won't live.

72
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:20,224
My father hates it, because I am just like him."

73
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:24,715
"Oh, I knew this house was strange!" Mary said.

74
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:29,079
"Everything is like a secret. Are you locked in this room?"

75
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:36,610
"No. I stay here because I don't want to be moved. It makes me too tired."

76
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,981
"Does your father come and see you?" asked Mary.

77
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:48,014
"Sometimes, when I'm asleep. But he doesn't want to." "Why?"

78
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,002
Colin looked upset and angry.

79
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:53,947
"My mother died when I was born.

80
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:56,745
It makes him unhappy to look at me.

81
00:05:56,745 --> 00:06:00,996
I remind him of her, because I look like her.

82
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:07,256
He thinks I don't know, but I do! I've heard the servants talking."

83
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:09,696
"Have you been here always?"

84
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:16,068
"Sometimes they take me to the sea, but I won't stay, because people stare at me.

85
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:18,862
I won't have people staring at me!

86
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:23,942
I used to wear an iron thing to keep my back straight.

87
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:29,386
But then a doctor from London came to see me, and made me take it off.

88
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:34,368
He said I didn't need it. All I needed was fresh air.

89
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:39,144
I hate fresh air. and I don't want to go outside."

90
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:43,638
"I didn't either, when I first came here," said Mary.

91
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:50,664
Colin didn't take his eyes off of Mary. "I don't want this to be a dream," he said.

92
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:56,326
"It isn't. We're both awake, and everyone else is asleep. Wait a minute,

93
00:06:56,326 --> 00:07:02,176
if you don't like people to see you, do you want me go away?" asked Mary.

94
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:06,708
Colin grabbed her sleeping gown. "No," he said.

95
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,988
"I would be sure I was dreaming, if you went.

96
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:16,890
Stay here and talk to me, if you are real. I want to hear all about you."

97
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,946
Mary made herself comfortable. She was curious about Colin, too.

98
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:24,183
"What do you want to know?"

99
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:28,808
Colin wanted to know how long she had been at Misselthwaite.

100
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:33,402
He wanted to know where her room was, and what she had been doing.

101
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:37,298
Did she hate the moor, like he did?

102
00:07:37,298 --> 00:07:42,630
Where had she lived before? Mary answered his many questions.

103
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:47,908
Colin made her tell him about India, and about her journey across the ocean.

104
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:51,520
Mary discovered that because Colin had been sick,

105
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,355
he hadn't learned as much as other children.

106
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:56,464
He had never been to school.

107
00:07:56,464 --> 00:08:00,204
One of his nurses had taught him to read when he was little.

108
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:03,970
Colin had been given all sorts of nice toys and books,

109
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,913
because his father was wealthy.

110
00:08:05,913 --> 00:08:08,874
He didn't seem to like them much, however.

111
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:14,786
He could have anything he wanted, and never did anything he didn't want to do.

112
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:20,500
"Everyone has to do what I want," He explained to Mary.

113
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,162
"If I am angry, I become sick.

114
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:29,442
No one things I'll live to grow up. How old are you?"

115
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,690
"I'm ten," said Mary, "the same age as you."

116
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,808
"How do you know how old I am?" Colin asked, surprised.

117
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:43,716
"Because when you were born, the garden door was locked and the key was hidden.

118
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:47,946
And it has been locked for ten years," said Mary.

119
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:50,841
Colin sat up in bed a little.

120
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:57,826
"What do you mean? What garden? Where is the key?" he asked, very interested.

121
00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:04,386
"There's - there's this garden that Mr. Craven hates," said Mary nervously.

122
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:08,361
"He locked the door and no one knows where he hid the key."

123
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:12,335
"What kind of a garden is it?" asked Colin.

124
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:18,166
"I don't know! No one has seen it for ten years," said Mary slowly.

125
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:23,621
She hadn't wanted to talk about the garden, but she couldn't help it.

126
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:29,401
Colin was too much like herself - all alone, with nothing to do.

127
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:33,345
He asked many questions. Where was it?

128
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:39,145
Had Mary ever looked for the door? Hadn't she asked the gardeners?

129
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,863
"They won't talk about it," said Mary.

130
00:09:42,863 --> 00:09:46,507
"I think they've been told not to answer questions."

131
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:50,555
"I would make them," said Colin.

132
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:55,502
Mary began to feel really frightened. What had she done?

133
00:09:55,502 --> 00:10:00,466
If Colin could make people talk about the garden, who knew what would happen!

134
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,762
"Everyone has to do what I say.

135
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:11,955
If I live, this house and everyone in it will belong to me," said Colin calmly.

136
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:15,112
"I can make them tell me anything."

137
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:17,244
Mary looked at the boy.

138
00:10:17,244 --> 00:10:22,464
She didn't realize that she and Colin had been raised in a similar way.

139
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:24,662
They were very alike.

140
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:29,495
To Mary, it seemed that Colin thought the whole world belonged to him!

141
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:33,700
"Do you really think you'll die?" she asked him.

142
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,224
She wanted to make him forget the garden.

143
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:41,264
"Oh, probably," he answered, as if he didn't care.

144
00:10:41,264 --> 00:10:46,974
"Ever since I was small, I've heard people say I won't live.

145
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:51,762
They think I didn't understand or hear, but I did."

146
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:55,166
"Do you want to live?" asked Mary.

147
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:59,234
"No," he answered, almost angrily.

148
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:03,032
"But I don't want to die. When I feel sick,

149
00:11:03,032 --> 00:11:08,614
I lie here alone and think about dying until I cry and cry."

150
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:11,364
Mary didn't know what to say.

151
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:15,643
"Let's talk about something else," said Colin.

152
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:19,898
"Tell me more about the garden. Don't you want to see it?"

153
00:11:19,898 --> 00:11:25,576
"Well...I suppose," said Mary in a low voice.

154
00:11:25,576 --> 00:11:32,262
"I do, too. I might want to go outside, if I could see that garden.

155
00:11:32,262 --> 00:11:36,891
I am going to make them unlock the door," said Colin.

156
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:41,447
Mary was horrified. Everything would be ruined!

157
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:43,415
Dickon would never come back.

158
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:48,752
"No, don't, don't do that! Please!" she cried.

159
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:52,985
"But you said you wanted to see it," said Colin.

160
00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:58,800
Mary felt like crying. "I do," she said quickly,

161
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,132
"but if you tell everyone about it,

162
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:03,389
then it won't be a secret anymore.

163
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,170
One day, maybe we could find it by ourselves.

164
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,933
I mean, if there was door.

165
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:13,860
Then it would be our garden. No one would know about it."

166
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,160
Colin thougth for a moment. "I never had a secret before,"

167
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,189
he said. "It might be nice."

168
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:27,958
"If you don't tell, I feel sure I can find out how to enter the garden.

169
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,144
We could find a nice boy to push you in your chair,

170
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:33,846
and we could go there alone.

171
00:12:33,846 --> 00:12:37,801
And then, perhaps, we can go and plant some seeds,

172
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:40,560
and make the garden come alive again.

173
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,430
I think it must be almost dead now, but maybe we could make some flowers grow."

174
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,522
"That sounds nice," said Colin softly.

175
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:54,042
He was feeling very sleepy and comfortable.

176
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:56,801
"I wouldn't mind being outside,

177
00:12:56,801 --> 00:13:01,101
if I was in a secret place where no one could see me.

178
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:03,523
Here, I am sleepy.

179
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:08,247
Sit beside me and tell me what you think the garden might look like."

180
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:15,677
So Mary sat beside Colin, and told him about what trees and bushes might be inside the garden,

181
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:20,557
and how many birds might build their nests there, because it was safe.

182
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:24,125
She pretended she'd never seen the garden before.

183
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:28,323
Then she told him about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff.

184
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:34,083
Colin enjoyed listening to Mary talk, and his eyes began to close.

185
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:39,235
He felt peaceful and calm, for the first time in a long while.

186
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,501
Mary felt a little worried.

187
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:47,895
"Colin, what will Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that I was here?" she asked.

188
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:51,084
"She will do what I tell her to do.

189
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:56,244
I will tell her I want you to come and talk to me every day.

190
00:13:56,244 --> 00:14:00,050
I'm glad you came," answered Colin.

191
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:05,196
"So am I. I'll come as often as I can," said Mary.

192
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:08,362
"But... I am going to be busy, you know.

193
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:10,676
I have to find that garden door."

194
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:16,519
"Yes, of course. You can tell me about it afterwards."

195
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:19,329
Now Mary was feeling sleepy herself.

196
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:24,346
"I've been here a long time," she said. "You must feel sleepy.

197
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:26,262
Should I go away now?"

198
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:33,392
"I wish I could fall asleep before you left me," said Colin, a little shyly.

199
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:34,959
"Close your eyes,

200
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,860
and I'll sing you an Indian song my Ayi used to sing to me," said Mary.

201
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,241
Somehow, she didn't want him to be awake and alone when she left.

202
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:48,702
She took his hand gently and sang softly.

203
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:52,841
"That is nice," he said, very sleepy.

204
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:59,120
Soon, his large gray eyes were closed and Mary could see he was sleeping deeply.

205
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,407
She took her candle and left the room as softly as a ghost.

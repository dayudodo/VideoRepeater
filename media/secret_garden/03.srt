CHAPTER THREE MEETING MARTHA

2
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:07,494
When Mary woke up, the sun was shining.

3
00:00:07,494 --> 00:00:09,767
She looked around her room.

4
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:12,039
It had a lot of nice furniture,

5
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:14,279
but it wasn't very cheerful.

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,886
It was more like an adult's room like a child's.

7
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:23,820
She was surprised to see a young woman in her room who was making a fire in the fireplace.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,570
She wore a maid's uniform.

9
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:29,826
Mary looked out the window at the grasslands.

10
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:33,641
The grass was dry and brown, because it was winter.

11
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:37,175
There were no trees or bushes growing on it.

12
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:44,623
All Mary could see was brown, dry grass, going on for miles and miles.

13
00:00:44,623 --> 00:00:49,263
"How do you do? I'm Martha. Do you like our moor?"

14
00:00:49,263 --> 00:00:52,289
asked the maid suddenly, in a cheerful voice.

15
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,445
"No, I hate it," said Mary.

16
00:00:56,445 --> 00:01:00,314
"That's because you're used to it," said Martha.

17
00:01:00,314 --> 00:01:04,674
"It's not very pretty now, but in spring it will be beautiful."

18
00:01:04,674 --> 00:01:08,590
"So you like the moor?" asked Mary.

19
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:13,590
"Oh, yes. In spring the grass is green and the birds are singing.

20
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:18,166
The fields are full of flowers and the air smells sweet.

21
00:01:18,238 --> 00:01:22,030
I wouldn't live away from the moors, not if you paid me!"

22
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:24,764
Mary listened to Martha talk.

23
00:01:24,764 --> 00:01:27,616
She thought this servant was very strange.

24
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:32,094
In India, the servants never talked to their masters like that,

25
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:34,736
as if the masters were their friends.

26
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:38,138
Indian servants only spoke when spoken to.

27
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:41,228
They were always quiet and obedient.

28
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:45,566
Mary had always hit her Ayi in the face when she was angry.

29
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:48,518
Mary looked at this young English woman.

30
00:01:48,518 --> 00:01:52,642
She wondered what Martha would do if Mary hit her.

31
00:01:52,642 --> 00:01:55,733
Probably she would hit her back!

32
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:59,274
"You are strange servant," Mary said.

33
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:02,672
Martha didn't seem upset by this comment.

34
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:07,172
She just laughed. "I know it," she said.

35
00:02:07,172 --> 00:02:11,388
"If Mr. Craven had a wife, I could never work here.

36
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:15,547
I'm too plain, and I don't speak like an educated lady.

37
00:02:15,547 --> 00:02:20,102
But this is a strange house, even though it seems so fancy.

38
00:02:20,102 --> 00:02:24,332
Mrs. Medlock gave me a job here because she's a friend of my family.

39
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:29,197
She said I couldn't work here, if this houses was like rich people's houses.

40
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:33,322
"Are you going to be my servants?" asked Mary.

41
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:37,464
"I'm Mrs. Medlock's servant," said Martha firmly.

42
00:02:37,464 --> 00:02:40,749
"Just like she's Mr. Craven's servant.

43
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:44,034
But I'll clean your room a little, and help you.

44
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:47,773
But you won't need more. You can take care of yourself."

45
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:51,363
Mary didn't understand what Martha was talking about.

46
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:55,132
"What do you mean? Who's going to dress me?"

47
00:02:55,132 --> 00:02:59,870
Martha stared at her. "What? Can't you dress yourself?"

48
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,701
"No. I never dressed myself in my life.

49
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:09,346
My Ayi always dressed me," said Mary. She didn't like this servant.

50
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:13,335
"Well," said Martha, "it's time for you to learn!

51
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:16,356
It will be good for you to take care of yourself.

52
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:21,857
I think it's amazing that rich people's children don't grow up to be very stupid.

53
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:24,874
They can't to anything for themselves.

54
00:03:24,874 --> 00:03:29,886
their nurses are always dressing and washing them, just like dolls."

55
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:33,908
"It is different in India," said Mary coldly.

56
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:36,967
"I'm sure it is," said Martha.

57
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:41,016
She didn't seem to know that servants weren't supposed to talk this way.

58
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:44,095
"It's because there are so many black people in India,

59
00:03:44,095 --> 00:03:46,745
instead of nice, normal white people.

60
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:51,416
When I heard you were coming from India, I thought you were black too!"

61
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,309
Now Mary was really angry.

62
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:59,400
"What!" she shouted. "You thought I was a black person?

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,052
How dare you! You daughter of a pig!"

64
00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:08,311
Instead of looking sorry, however, Martha just looked angry.

65
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:11,646
"Who are you calling names?" she said.

66
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:14,362
"A young lady shouldn't talk that way.

67
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:18,176
I've always thought black people must be very nice.

68
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:21,299
I heard that they are very religious.

69
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,835
I was hoping to see one.

70
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:26,684
When I came into your room this morning,

71
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:29,476
I walked over to your bed to see you.

72
00:04:29,476 --> 00:04:34,436
And there you were. You're not any blacker than I am!

73
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:37,640
You're just very yellow," Martha said.

74
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,454
She seemed disappointed that Mary wasn't an Indian.

75
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:45,640
Mary had never been so angry or embarrassed.

76
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,438
"I can't believe you thought I was a native Indian!

77
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:53,332
You know nothing about India!

78
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:55,822
The natives aren't people,

79
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:59,888
They're servants who have to do whatever white people want.

80
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:03,734
You don't know anything!" she shouted.

81
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:07,682
Suddenly she was feeling confused and alone.

82
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:12,336
She did not understand this strange new country or its customs.

83
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:17,661
She felt terribly lonely, and everyone she knew was dead.

84
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:19,630
She began to cry.

85
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:25,262
Martha looked upset. "There, there. Don't cry!" she said.

86
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:28,085
"I didn't know you'd be angry.

87
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:31,767
You're right -- I don't know anything.

88
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:35,590
You mustn't cry, Miss Mary!" she said gently.

89
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,390
Soon Mary stopped crying. She felt a little better.

90
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,005
Martha looked very relieved.

91
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:45,752
"Now, it's time for you to get up.

92
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:51,846
Mrs. Medlock told me to bring you your meals into the room next to this.

93
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:55,751
I'll help you with your clothes," she said.

94
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:58,725
Martha helped Mary get dressed.

95
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:03,652
Martha thought to herself that she had never seen a child like Mary.

96
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:07,944
Mary just stood and waited for Martha to put her clothes on!

97
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:11,048
It was as if she didn't have hands or feet.

98
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:15,509
"Why don't you put on your shoes?" asked Martha.

99
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,864
"My Ayi did it," said Mary. "It was the custom."

100
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:24,704
If Martha had been a well-trained maid, for a rich lady,

101
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:26,869
then things would have been different.

102
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:30,541
Martha would have been quiet and obedient to Mary.

103
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,908
But Martha was only a poor York-shire girl,

104
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:36,875
who had many small brothers and sisters.

105
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:40,808
These children always dressed and fed themselves.

106
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:46,219
So it is understandable that Martha thought Mary was a very strange girl.

107
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:52,265
As for Mary, she had never known a servent who talked as much as Martha.

108
00:06:52,265 --> 00:06:56,401
In India, the servants were always quiet.

109
00:06:56,401 --> 00:07:00,542
At first Mary was not interested in Martha's talk,

110
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:06,028
but soon she began to listen. Martha was talking about her family.

111
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:10,427
"Oh! You should see them all," she said.

112
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:15,667
"There are twelve of us, and my father has a hard time making money.

113
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:19,166
It's hard for Mother to find food for everyone.

114
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,715
But the children just run and play outside.

115
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:25,852
Mother says the fresh air fattens them up.

116
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:30,418
Perhaps they eat the grass, just like our Dickon's pony."

117
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:34,047
"Where did he get the pony?" asked Mary.

118
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:36,956
"He found it when it was a baby.

119
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,164
It was alone on the moor;

120
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:43,917
its mother had died. Dickon began to make friends with it.

121
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:46,276
He found it grass to eat.

122
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:49,343
Now, the pony let's him ride on his back.

123
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:53,696
Dickon is a kind boy, and animals like him."

124
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:57,328
Mary had never had a animal of her own.

125
00:07:57,328 --> 00:08:00,182
She had always thought she might like one.

126
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:03,669
She began to feel a little interested in Dickon.

127
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:09,632
This was important, because Mary had never been interested in anyone but herself.

128
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:14,324
When Mary went into the little sitting room next to the bedroom,

129
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:17,605
she saw that a breakfast was laid out of her.

130
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:21,482
But Mary had always had a very small appetite.

131
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:24,232
She looked at the food without interest.

132
00:08:24,232 --> 00:08:27,736
"I don't want it," she said.

133
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:33,116
"What!" said Martha. "You don't want your breakfast?"

134
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:39,136
"No." "You don't know how good it is," said Martha.

135
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:46,126
"I don't want it," repeated Mary. "Hm!" said Martha.

136
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,288
"I can't stand to see good food be wasted.

137
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:52,146
I wish my brothers and sisters were here.

138
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:55,334
They would eat everything in two minutes!"

139
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,372
"Why?" asked Mary.

140
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:03,424
"Why! Because they've never had a full stomach in their lives.

141
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:06,952
They're always hungry," said Martha.

142
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:11,616
"I don't know what it means, to be hungry," said Mary.

143
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:16,076
"Well, it would be good for you to learn!" said Martha.

144
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:20,442
"I don't understand people who just stare at good bread and meat.

145
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:25,070
Don't I wish Dickon and Phil and Jane had what's on this table!"

146
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,027
"Why don't you take it to them?" asked Mary.

147
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:33,192
"It's not mine," said Martha firmly.

148
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:36,616
Mary drank some tea and ate a little toast.

149
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:39,695
When she had finished, Martha said,

150
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:43,513
"Well, there's nothing for you to do in the house.

151
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:45,782
You should go outside and play."

152
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:49,433
"Who will go with me?" Mary asked.

153
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:53,328
"You'll go by yourself," Martha said .

154
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:58,119
"You'll have to play alone, just like my brothers and sisters do.

155
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:02,843
Our Dickon goes off alone by himself and plays for hours.

156
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:04,997
That's how he met his pony.

157
00:10:04,997 --> 00:10:07,820
There are wild sheep that know him too.

158
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,145
Even if there's little to eat,

159
00:10:10,145 --> 00:10:14,699
Dickon always saves a bit of bread to give to his pets."

160
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:19,204
The mention of Dickon and his animals made Mary decide to go out.

161
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:23,796
She wanted to see if the birds of England were different from those in India.

162
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:29,668
"If you walk around the outside of the house, you'll find the gardens," said Martha.

163
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:35,697
"There are lots of flowers in the summer, but there's nothing growing now," she said.

164
00:10:35,697 --> 00:10:37,843
Then she thought for a moment.

165
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:42,032
"One of the gardens is locked up," she said.

166
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:45,322
"There's a wall around it, just like the other gardens.

167
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:47,569
But there's no door to this garden.

168
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:50,902
No one has been inside it for ten years."

169
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:53,574

1
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:40,359
好，我先说 - 好
Okay. I'll go first. Um-- Okay.

2
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:43,946
其实，我们根本不用来
Let me say, uh, we don't really need to be here.

3
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:48,367
- 我们结婚已经5年了- 6年
See, we've been married five years.- Six.

4
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:53,372
- 5、6年了，这就好像给汽车做个年检
- Five, six years. And this is like a checkup for us.

5
00:00:53,622 --> 00:00:56,716
有机会可以检查一下引擎
Um, a chance to poke around the engine...

6
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:01,021
- 换换机油,替换一两个密封条 - 没错
maybe change the oil,replace a seal or two.- Yeah.

7
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:06,844
很好，那我们开始吧
Very well then. Let's pop the hood.

8
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:11,223
从1分到10分，你们会给彼此之间的感情打几分？
On a scale of one to 1 0,how happy are you as a couple?

9
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,601
- 8分- 等一下
- Eight.- Wait.

10
00:01:13,726 --> 00:01:17,105
10分代表非常愉快，1分代表非常痛苦，还是……？
Ten being perfectly happy and one being totally miserable?

11
00:01:17,313 --> 00:01:20,441
- 凭直觉说 - 好
- Just respond instinctively.- Okay.

12
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:23,819
- 准备好了么？- 好了
- Ready? - Ready.

13
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:25,237
- 8分 - 8分
- Eight.- Eight.

14
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:30,951
你们多长时间做次爱？
How often do you have sex?

15
00:01:31,076 --> 00:01:33,996
这道题我不懂
I don't understand the question.

16
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:37,040
我也糊涂了，也要打1到10分吗？
Yeah, I'm lost.Is this a 1-to-10 thing?

17
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:40,253
那1分是表示做得很少，还是根本不做了？
Like, is one very little,or is one nothing?

18
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:41,831
严格来讲
Because, you know...

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,699
0分才是根本不做了
tech-technically speaking...the zero would be nothing.

20
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:48,642
是的，我们不知道什么是1分，什么是10分
That's right. And if we don't know what one is-What's 10?

21
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:52,770
嗯，因为10分，天啊
- Yeah, 'cause 10 Oh, God.

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,407
- 永恒的 - 不屈不挠的
- Constant. Uh... - Unrelenting.

23
00:01:57,052 --> 00:02:00,249
- 不停下来，我是说，就像… - 没什么可吃的
- N-Not stopping for, like.. I mean,just..- Nothing to eat.

24
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,858
就像抢劫
Like Sting.

25
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,404
抢劫也就是一天的活
Well, look at Sting's day job.

26
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:08,824
谁一周有60小时做这个呢？
Who else has 60 hours a week to put in the sack?

27
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:11,261
这不是1到10的游戏，这是基本问题
It's not a one-to-1 0 scenario. It's a basic question.

28
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:13,796
你们一周做爱几次？
How often do you have sex?

29
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:23,739
那就说说这个星期吧
How about this week?

30
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:29,870
- 周末也算吗？- 当然
- Including the weekend? - Sure.

31
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:37,987
说说你们是怎么认识的？
Describe how you first met.

32
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:42,632
- 那是在哥伦比亚 - 博格达
Uh, it was- It was in Colombia.- Bogota.

33
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:45,943
-5年前 -是6年

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,972
好吧，5、6年前

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,570
不，不是，没事
No, no, no, no.Esta bien.

- 为了虎口脱险 - 干杯
- To dodging bullets.- To dodging bullets.

41
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:20,354
话说完了
So, it speaks.

42
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,732
跳个舞怎么样？
But does it dance?

43
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:44,195
嗨，陌生人
Hiya, stranger.

44
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:46,759

没有客房服务
I think room service fled.

I knew Gladys for two and a half years before I asked her to marry me.

You have to have a foundation of friendship,brother. The other stuff fades.

他是搞建筑的，有名的承包商

82
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:34,896
只要华尔街上哪台服务器坏了
A server goes down on Wall Street...

83

无论何时何地，她总是会及时出现
she's there anytime,day or night.

84
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:43,768
就像电脑界的蝙蝠侠
She's like Batman for computers.

85
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:47,689
他的性格和我也很像，简直是天生一对
He's gone as much as I am,so... it's perfect.

86
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:51,859

你看维克斯勒大夫怎么样
What did you think of Dr. Wexler?

95
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,433
他的问题有些不知所谓
His questions were a bit wishy-washy.

96
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:58,675
是啊，小心手臂，不是很有见地
Yeah. Sorry.Not the most insightful.

97
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:02,596
他的办公室在城市另一边

晚饭7点钟

103
00:13:12,472 --> 00:13:14,515
- 亲爱的 - 时间正好
- Hi, baby.- Perfect timing.

104
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,934
外面下好大的雨
It's pissin' rain out there.

105
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:24,702
给你奶油 我买的
Here's your butter.I bring you butter.

没什么，我凑合用吧
It's fine. I'll make it work.

114
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:57,000
我买了新窗帘
Oh, I got new curtains.

115
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:01,473
你看怎么样？
Well?What do you think?

116
00:14:02,077 --> 00:14:04,078
呃
Huh.

117
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,890
还有一个矮个子男人也想买这个窗帘，我们争了好半天
There was a struggle over the material.- This little tea sandwich of a man

118
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,899
是他先看到的 但最后还是我赢了
- He got his hands on them first, but I won.

119
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,061
当然
Of course you did.

120
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,141
新窗帘偏绿，沙发和地毯都需要换一下才相衬
They're a bit green. I think we're gonna have to reupholster the sofas...

121
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:17,188
我想换条波斯地毯，你看呢？
and definitely get a new rug,maybe a Persian.

122
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:22,196
要不就还用原来的，这样就什么都不用换了
Or we can keep the old ones.Then we don't have to change a thing.

123
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:25,199
我们不是已经谈过这件事儿了吗？记得么
We talked about this.You remember?

124
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:32,039
我记得我们说要先等一等的
I remember. I remember 'cause we said we'd wait.

125
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,585
如果你不喜欢，我就去退掉
If you don't like 'em,we can take 'em back.

126
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:39,797
好吧，我不喜欢
Okay. I don't like 'em.

127
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:43,008
你会慢慢习惯的
You'll get used to 'em.

128
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,968
我喜欢
I like 'em.

129
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,796
(信用卡)免年息，促销到3月份为止
Huh. Zero percent A.P.R. till March.

130
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:29,926
现在我们开始第二阶段
So, part two. Here we are.

131
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:33,263
只不过这次你是一个人来的，这是为什么呢？
Only this time,you came back alone.Why did you come back?

132
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:35,640
我也不清楚
I'm not sure really.

133
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,935
我先声明，我爱我妻子
Let me clarify.I love my wife.

134
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,772
我希望她幸福
Um, I want her to be happy.

135
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:45,191
我希望她一切顺利
Uh, I want good things for her.

136
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:48,778
但有时候，我……
But there are times...

137
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:09,479
- 亲爱的，你能不能……- 再看5分钟
- Honey, would you just...- Five more minutes.

138
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:12,706
那么问题是什么
So what's the problem?

139
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,596
我们之间存在着巨大的距离
There's this huge space between us...

140
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:21,394
因为有很多事情，我们都不告诉对方
and it just keeps filling up with everything that we don't say to each other.

141
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,605
- 这叫什么来着? - 婚姻
- What is that called? - Marriage.

142
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:28,234
你们不告诉对方的是些什么事情呢？
What don't you sayto each other?

143
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:34,326
呃
Uh- Hmm.

144
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:41,330
看上去不错嘛，新菜式？
This looks nice.Did you do something new?

145
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:44,250
- 嗯 - 是吗？
- Mm-hmm.- Yeah?

146
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,962
- 我加了豌豆 - 对，豌豆

00:46:03,107 --> 00:46:05,526
烤肉我最爱吃了
Pot roast is my favorite.

431
00:46:05,651 --> 00:46:08,529
亲爱的，能把盐递给我么？
Sweetheart,could you pass the salt?

432
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:47,576
你用了什么新花样吗？- 嗯
- Did you try something new?- Mm-hmm.

433
00:47:04,718 --> 00:47:06,762
亚特兰大怎么样？
So, how was Atlanta?

434
00:47:07,763 --> 00:47:12,476
我们那边也有问题，数目对不上
Had a few problems ourselves.Some figures didn't add up.

435
00:47:12,642 --> 00:47:15,101
- 严重吗？- 生死攸关
- Big deal?- Life or death.

436
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:17,465
来点葡萄酒？ - 好的
- Wine?- Yeah.

437
00:47:39,586 --> 00:47:41,755
- 我来收拾吧 - 我去拿毛巾
- I got it. - I got it. I'll get a towel.

438
00:47:53,892 --> 00:47:55,852
珍妮？
Janey?

439
00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:01,483
宝贝？
Honey?

440
00:48:09,532 --> 00:48:11,367
珍妮！
Jane!

441
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:19,667
珍妮！
Jane!

442
00:48:22,962 --> 00:48:24,964
我怎么这么笨！
How could I be so stupid?

443
00:48:36,142 --> 00:48:37,477
珍妮！珍妮！
Jane.!Jane.!

444
00:48:37,643 --> 00:48:39,562
珍妮！
Jane.!

445
00:48:58,714 --> 00:48:59,172
喔，天啊！
God.

446
00:48:59,272 --> 00:49:01,672
哦 天哪
Oh, dear God.

447
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:11,394
不，不，刚才不是故意的！那是意外
Wait. No, no, no, no.Accident.

448
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:13,629
宝贝，是个意外！
Honey? Accident.

449
00:49:13,696 --> 00:49:16,449
珍妮，停车 马上
Jane, stop the car! Now!

450
00:49:17,366 --> 00:49:19,535
珍妮？
Jane.!

451
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,621
你反应过度了
You've overreacting!

452
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:24,916
亲爱的 别这样好吗
Honey, let's not get carried away.

453
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:27,752
我不想让你生气，我们可以谈谈
We don't wanna go to sleep angry.

454
00:49:27,877 --> 00:49:29,045
天哪！
God!

455
00:49:29,212 --> 00:49:30,880
把车停下来
Pull over.

456
00:49:31,005 --> 00:49:33,591
停车，停车！
Pull over.! Pull over.!

457
00:49:35,843 --> 00:49:37,762
你听着……
Now, look

458
00:49:42,808 --> 00:49:45,061
我们得谈谈！
We need to talk!

459
00:49:54,327 --> 00:49:55,294
好了 来了 来了
Okay, I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

460
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,298
- 来了，是谁啊？- 开门
- Who is it? - Open up.

461
00:50:01,661 --> 00:50:04,664
- 你怎么了？- 我老婆
- What the hell happened to you?- My wife.

462
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,464
- 她想杀了我 - 是吗，听我说
- She tried to kill me.- Yes, she did. And you know what?

463
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:16,315
我老婆也想杀了我，不过不是用车
Gladys tried to kill me, not with a car.

464
00:50:16,415 --> 00:50:17,952
至少你老婆更直截了当
At leastJane was a man about it.She was up front about it.

465
00:50:18,052 --> 00:50:22,088
事实上，她们都想杀了我们，
They all try to kill you- slowly, painfully, cripplingly.

466
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:23,499
一点一点地折磨你
And then-wham.They hurt you.

467
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,103
你知道我当初有多难受吗？我曾经自虐
You know how hurt I used to be over her,and I used to beat myself up?

468
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:29,128
现在好了 我成天都在交女朋友，
Now I'm great. I got dates all the time.

469
00:50:29,228 --> 00:50:30,590
我醒悟了，我找回了自我
I just woke up from a thing.I'm in my robe.

470
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,733
- 你和你妈住在一起 - 我之所以这样
- You live with your mom. - I live with my mom because I choose to.

471
00:50:32,858 --> 00:50:34,737
是因为她是我唯一可以信任的女人
Because that's the only woman I've ever trusted.

472
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:36,534
她们大部分是被动侵略性的
Most of them are passive-aggressive.

473
00:50:36,635 --> 00:50:39,536
这是心理学，我读了书，得到了观点
There's a whole psychology.I've been reading books,given what I've gone through.

474
00:50:39,638 --> 00:50:41,265
很恶心
And, uh, it's disgusting.

475
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:44,740
你知道吗，这地球上没什么比一个13岁女孩更凶残了
Do you know there is nothing more cruelon this Earth than a 1 3-year-old girl.

476
00:50:44,843 --> 00:50:47,038
她们在高中就结成小圈子
They literally form cliques in high school.

477
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:50,012
她们还互相较劲，划清界线
And they play cruel games on each other.A-And test boundaries with each other.

478
00:50:50,115 --> 00:50:50,650
- 你在说什么？
- What are you talking about?

479
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,083
在说你要明白的…
I'm just saying about you have to understand-

480
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:54,151
我在这受着伤，你却说13岁女孩
I'm hurting over here.And you're talking about 1 3-year-old girls.

481
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:56,152
因为我想帮你战胜疼痛
Because I'm trying to get you past the hurt.

482
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:58,688
你要了解你的敌人
You have to understand the enemy what you're up against.

483
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,951
我知道你在想什么
I know exactly what you're thinkin'.

484
00:51:01,035 --> 00:51:04,038
她连这个都对你说谎，那还有什么不能骗你的呢？
If she lied about that, what else is it possible that she lied about?

485
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:07,733
她是个间谍，专门监视别人的行动
Her job is a spy to get information from people.

486
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:12,738
法国海滨，游艇，伊朗王子……
French Riviera, a yacht? An Iranian prince?

487
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:17,367
她用色相来套取情报，太恶心了
She's supposed to get close to him and gain his trust. It's disgusting.

488
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:19,536
什么？你说什么？
What?What are you saying?

489
00:51:19,661 --> 00:51:23,582
什么？你丈夫是那个杀手？
What?Your husband is the shooter?

490
00:51:23,707 --> 00:51:26,001
那不可能
That's impossible.

491
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:28,503
真的
Really?

492
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:32,674
也许这一开始就是一个布置好的局，专门监视你
This whole thing was probably planned from the beginning.

493
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:35,596
在你身边潜伏了6年，收集情报，
Operation Stake OutJohnny. A six-year stakeout to get information from you.

494
00:51:35,861 --> 00:51:37,829
现在任务完成了
Mission accomplished.

495
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:41,599
好吧
Okay.

496
00:51:42,642 --> 00:51:44,853
看开一点
Here's the upside.

497
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:46,938
- 你并不爱他 - 没错
- You don't love him. - No.

498
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:50,977
那就杀了他，你是最好的杀手
You'll kill him, and nobody's better at that than you are.

499
00:51:51,077 --> 00:51:53,671
- 谢谢 - 然后一切就都结束了
- Thank you. - And then it'll be over.

500
00:52:03,388 --> 00:52:07,415
- 如果她窃听怎么办？- 什么？
-  What if she's listening? - What?

501
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:10,426
你觉得她可能窃听这房子吗？
Do you think it's possible that she rigged the house?

502
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:12,496
- 哦，天啊 - 伙计
-Oh, my God. - Hey, dude.

503
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:16,192
很可能，因为她周围那群人
It could be very possible because of th-the pattern of how she's handled stuff.

504
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,825
我不奇怪，这也许是她不喜欢我的原因
It wouldn't surprise me. That's probably why she doesn't like me.

505
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:21,370
- 因为她听到我叫她侏儒 - 你疯了
- Because she heard me call her a troll. - You're out of your mind.

506
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,872
我说这是可能的，那女人要开车撞死你
I'm just saying it's possible. The woman just tried to run you over with a car-

507
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,909
她可能会听到
That she could hear you.

508
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,478
我才不管，我希望她在听
And I don't give a shit.I hope she is listening.

509
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:31,571
我希望你在听，珍妮，你知道吗，我在注意你
I hope you are listening,Jane.You know what, I'm on to you.

510
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:34,674
你也许在愚弄我的兄弟，因为他瞎了，没什么，她知道
You might have fooled my boy, 'cause he was blinded. It's okay. She knows this.

511
00:52:34,786 --> 00:52:37,380
但是我不是我，我希望你在听
But I'm not me.I hope you're listening to me.

512
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:40,423
我希望你知道我曾和你朋友杰斯麦睡过觉
And I hope you know th-that I slept with your friend,Jasmine. Huh?

513
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:42,015
- 嘘 - 我们主动
- Shh.- We're on the board.

514
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:44,560
我们主动
I'm just saying we're on the board my man. Come on. We're on the board.

515
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,130
你以为是37比0，我们会得5分
You thought it was 37-0. We got five points on the board.

516
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:50,928
杰斯麦床上功夫很差的 约翰 我不是...
I nailed Jasmine and she was bad in bed, baby.Johnny, I'm not-

517
00:52:51,061 --> 00:52:54,856
约翰，我知道你很尴尬，不过你放心，我埃迪不是别人
I know you're embarrassed, but, come on,it's me. It's Eddie you're talkin'to.

518
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:58,276
我不会和其他同事说的 我谁也不会说的
The guys we work with, they don't know.I'm never gonna tell them.

519
00:52:58,401 --> 00:53:00,646
或许你老婆的同事可能因此在嘲笑她很长一段时间
The people she works with probably got a big laugh over this over the last six years.

520
00:53:00,746 --> 00:53:02,771
但是又怎样呢 谁在乎 这并不重要
But so what? Who cares? That's not important.

521
00:53:03,364 --> 00:53:06,076
听着，这就像一本已经写了150页的书
Lookit, it's like 1 50 pages of a book have been written.

522
00:53:06,443 --> 00:53:10,114
前150页，约翰就是个大傻蛋
In the first 1 50 pages,Johnny's been a clown.

523
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:16,954
但你还可以写最后10页，虽然你被蒙骗了 但是你可以反败为胜
You can write the last 1 0 pages.You've been smoked,but you can write the last 1 0 pages.

524
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:20,958
能跟你这样谈谈心是我的荣幸，我们应该经常这么谈谈心
Great talk, man. We should do it more often. It was a great talk.

525
00:53:21,124 --> 00:53:24,253
- 我借这个用用 - 我支持你
- I'm proud of you.- I'm gonna borrow this.

526
00:53:24,378 --> 00:53:26,338
- 要不明天早晨再干吧- 行
- I like where your head's at.
- I'll do it in the morning.

527
00:53:27,923 --> 00:53:29,216
- 你还好吗？- 好
- You okay?- Yep. Okay.

528
00:53:29,383 --> 00:53:32,052
- 那好 晚安- 晚安
- Good night.- Good night.

529
00:53:47,242 --> 00:53:49,161
你不爱他
You don't love him.

530
00:53:49,286 --> 00:53:52,205
- 晚安，约翰- 晚安，埃迪
- Good night,John.- Good night, Eddie.

531
00:53:52,331 --> 00:53:54,625
晚安，妈妈
- Good night, Mom.

532
00:54:42,672 --> 00:54:44,257
姐妹们，开始吧
Okay, girls, let's go.

533
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:48,052
袋装垃圾，收据，火柴盒，你们都知道应该干些什么
Pocket litter, receipts, matchbooks.You know the drill.

534
00:55:07,196 --> 00:55:10,491
很好 谁把这个翻出来了？
This is nice. Who picked this out?

535
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,705
- 这是什么？- 好像是你的婚礼
- What is this?- It looks like your wedding.

536
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,292
我知道，你们看这个干嘛？
I know what it is. What are you doing?

537
00:55:18,317 --> 00:55:19,317
调查目标背景

00:58:00,924 --> 00:58:03,510
嗨，老公，我不是告诉过你不要来办公室找我么？
I thought I told you not to bother me at the office, honey.

570
00:58:03,635 --> 00:58:09,474
- 你目前还是史密斯夫人 - 又不光我一个人叫史密斯夫人
- Well, you are still Mrs. Smith. - Well, so are a lot of girls.

571
00:58:09,641 --> 00:58:12,227
小心点，珍妮，我随时可能进来干掉你们
Careful,Jane. I can push the button anytime, anywhere, sweetheart.

572
00:58:12,352 --> 00:58:15,814
就是给你地图，你也找不到我们
Baby, you couldn't find the button with both hands and a map.

573
00:58:18,066 --> 00:58:20,985
最后的警告，你还是逃吧
Last warning. You need to disappear.

574
00:58:21,152 --> 00:58:22,278
- 不  - 现在
- no  - now

575
00:58:22,403 --> 00:58:23,863
D区安全
""D'' Sector clear.

576
00:58:23,988 --> 00:58:26,171
你想要我翻个身假装睡着了吗？
You really expect me to roll over and play dead?

577
00:58:26,271 --> 00:58:28,309
我们结婚5年了，你应该习惯了
You should be used to it after five years of marriage.

578
00:58:28,409 --> 00:58:31,076
是6年，我是不会逃走的
Six. And I'm not leaving.

579
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:33,076
"E"区安全
""E'' Sector clear.

580
00:58:33,178 --> 00:58:34,440
嗯
Uh-huh.

581
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:36,960
随时随地
Anywhere, anytime.

582
00:58:37,669 --> 00:58:38,984
发现入侵者
Intruder detected.

583
00:58:39,921 --> 00:58:41,320
立即撤离，C计划
Evacuate. Plan ""C.''

584
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:53,554
正在撤离
Evacuation in progress.

585
00:58:55,399 --> 00:58:57,367
正在撤离
Evacuation in progress.

586
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:09,345
正在撤离
Evacuation in progress.

587
00:59:09,447 --> 00:59:11,438
这边已经搞定了
I've already done this side.

588
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:12,846
出发！
Let's go.!

589
01:00:11,755 --> 01:00:13,423
胆小鬼！
Chickenshit!

590
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:14,852
孬种！
Pussy.!

591
01:00:20,766 --> 01:00:23,435
你拿枪对着她，却没有开枪
You're tellin'me you had a shot at her and you didn't take it?

592
01:00:23,852 --> 01:00:26,288
还给我带来这么多垃圾
What I'm trying to say is we got all this stuffhere...

593
01:00:26,388 --> 01:00:28,481
你想说你搞不定她？
and you're trying to tell me you couldn't take her out?

594
01:00:28,607 --> 01:00:32,260
现在她成了我们两个人的敌人，
Well, now she's a problem for both of us.

595
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,328
我家就是她的首要目标
Now my house is priority one.

596
01:00:34,446 --> 01:00:36,365
来帮我一把，好吗？
Just give me a hand,will ya?

597
01:00:36,531 --> 01:00:40,050
拜托 拿着个钳子对着个破炉子，你不疯我都要疯了
Please. You're driving me crazy with the tongs in the furnace.You're like an insane man.

598
01:00:40,514 --> 01:00:43,872
好吧 他们给你48小时，
All right. They gave you 48 hours.

599
01:00:43,972 --> 01:00:44,481
我们还剩下多少时间？
What do we got left here?

600
01:00:44,581 --> 01:00:48,043
- 23？22？- 18个小时多一点
Twenty-three? Twenty-two? - Eighteen and change.

601
01:00:48,168 --> 01:00:50,261
过了这18个小时你就完蛋了？
You got 18 hours until they close the book on both of you?

602
01:00:50,261 --> 01:00:51,010
埃迪？
Eddie.

603
01:00:51,676 --> 01:00:54,122
妈！我们处于高度戒备，
Mom! We're on high alert here!

604
01:00:54,138 --> 01:00:56,427
刚才我差点就把你杀了
I almost killed you right then!

605
01:00:56,484 --> 01:01:00,572
- 你还不知道！- 没事儿
You do not even realize! - Never mind.

606
01:01:00,597 --> 01:01:03,767
这一切我受够了
I am so done playing games with this broad.

607
01:01:03,892 --> 01:01:05,354
你应该照她头上来一枪
You gotta take this bitch out head-on.

608
01:01:05,727 --> 01:01:07,379
不用你教我该怎么对付我老婆
Don't tell me how to handle my wife.

609
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:10,815
她不再是你老婆了，她是敌人，现在她也许就在外面
This broad is not your wife.She's the enemy. And she could be outside right now.!

610
01:01:10,982 --> 01:01:12,776
埃迪
Eddie.

611
01:01:12,901 --> 01:01:15,111
找到了
Got it.

612
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:19,532
很好，只剩下最后一步了
Now we're talkin'. Only question is how much is it to buy a vowel?

613
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:28,708
- 黑弓地产 - 你好，我是埃坦科技的
- Blackbow Realty. -  Yes. Hi. I'm calling from I-Temp.

614
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:31,050
太好了！我们的新居建得怎么样了
Oh, great.How's that new penthouse working out?

615
01:01:31,419 --> 01:01:34,422
不错，多谢关心
Well,just fine.Thank you for asking.

616
01:02:02,033 --> 01:02:05,050
我们是保安，你的电梯有问题，先生
This is security.There seems to be a problem with your elevator, sir.

617
01:02:05,536 --> 01:02:08,237
你希望我们派个工程师来检查一下吗？
Do you want an engineer to come up and, uh, see what the problem is?

618
01:02:08,437 --> 01:02:10,244
慢慢来，我在这里挺舒服的
Take your time.I'm really quite comfortable.

619
01:02:11,542 --> 01:02:13,050
你真的挺舒服么？
Are you really comfortable?

620
01:02:14,545 --> 01:02:16,297
珍妮？
Jane?

621
01:02:17,465 --> 01:02:18,266
是你么，亲爱的？
Is that you, sweetheart?

622
01:02:20,134 --> 01:02:23,137
第一次，也是最后一次警告，约翰，逃命吧
First and last warning,John. Get out of town.

623
01:02:24,013 --> 01:02:26,307
你知道我哪里也不会去的
You know I'm not goin' anywhere.

624
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,281
别嘴硬了
Oh, well, so you say.

625
01:02:28,381 --> 01:02:30,127
你现在陷在70层楼上的一个铁盒子里
But right now you're trapped in a steel box

626
01:02:30,227 --> 01:02:32,688
你下面除了空气什么都没有
hanging 7 0 floors over nothin' but air.

627
01:02:32,813 --> 01:02:34,983
喔，这原来是个陷阱
Oh, so this is a trap.

628
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:36,384
他在3号电梯
He's in car three.

629
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,652
这对我没用，宝贝
It's never gonna work, honey.

630
01:02:38,778 --> 01:02:43,491
因为你总是低估我的能力
It's never gonna work because you constantly underestimate me.

631
01:02:43,657 --> 01:02:46,619
- 是吗？- 你不知道我是谁
- Do I? - You have no idea who I am.

632
01:02:46,744 --> 01:02:49,538
你不知道我有多大能耐
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

633
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:52,235
彼此彼此
Well, back at you, baby.

634
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:56,548
让我猜猜看,平衡缆绳上装有炸药
Let me guess. Shaped charge on the counterbalance cable.

635
01:02:56,548 --> 01:02:59,141
主副刹车上应该还有两个
Two more on the primary and secondary brakes.

636
01:02:59,924 --> 01:03:01,383
对吧？
Maybe?

637
01:03:01,508 --> 01:03:04,053
- 他发现了 - 不用你多嘴
- He found them. - Yes. Thank you.

638
01:03:04,178 --> 01:03:06,504
那你知道主缆绳上还有另外一个炸药吗？
Did you also get the base charge at the principal cable?

639
01:03:09,757 --> 01:03:12,760
除非你答应离开，否则我就引爆
Promise to leave town, or I'll blow it.

640
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:21,144
好吧，我投降
Okay. I give up.

641
01:03:22,436 --> 01:03:25,189
炸吧
Blow it.

642
01:03:25,356 --> 01:03:28,776
- 什么？ - 动手吧，炸吧
- What? - Go on. Blow it.

643
01:03:28,901 --> 01:03:32,947
- 你以为我不会吗？ - 我认为你不会
- You think I won't? - I- I think you won't.

644
01:03:34,073 --> 01:03:36,450
那好
Okay.

645
01:03:36,575 --> 01:03:39,120
5，4 ……
Five, four-

646
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:42,957
- 有什么遗言吗？- 新窗帘真难看
- Any last words? - The new curtains are hideous.

647
01:03:43,124 --> 01:03:44,125
再见，约翰
Good-bye,John.

648
01:03:55,719 --> 01:04:00,516
- 这是怎么回事儿 - 你说.....再见
- What the hell was that? - You said good-bye.

649
01:04:11,652 --> 01:04:14,029
瓦斯！把瓦斯关掉！
Shut off the gas.!

650
01:04:37,496 --> 01:04:39,456
珍妮
Jane.

651
01:05:49,693 --> 01:05:52,529
女士
Madame.

652
01:05:52,654 --> 01:05:55,990
我有几句话要说
Thought of a number of lines for this moment.

653
01:05:56,116 --> 01:06:00,995
“我只是路过”“嘿，宝贝，谢谢你捅了我一刀”
""Thought I'd just drop in.'' ""Hey, doll. Thanks for givin' me the shaft.''

654
01:06:01,121 --> 01:06:04,749
不错么，你决定什么了
Nice. So, what did you decide?

655
01:06:05,542 --> 01:06:07,752
我想要离婚
I want a divorce.

656
01:06:08,253 --> 01:06:12,131
好啊，当初你在这里向我求婚，现在也算有始有终
I like it.You proposed to me here,so it has agreeable symmetry.

657
01:06:12,257 --> 01:06:14,550
你的衣服，先生？
Coat, sir?

658
01:06:15,885 --> 01:06:18,179
- 我可以坐么？ - 不可以
- May I sit? - No.

659
01:06:33,611 --> 01:06:36,572
- 香槟？ - 不，香槟是庆祝时才喝的
- Champagne, sir? - No. Champagne's for celebrating.

660
01:06:36,697 --> 01:06:39,826
- 给我来杯马蒂尼 - 我什么都不要，谢谢
- I'll have a martini. - I'm fine. Thank you.

661
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:45,397
我喜欢你的裙子
I like the dress.

662
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,560
我穿的是丧服
I'm in mourning.

663
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,604
你应该多穿穿
You should wear it more often.

664
01:06:51,413 --> 01:06:54,499
你想要什么，约翰？
So, what do you want,John?

665
01:06:54,624 --> 01:06:57,252
珍妮，我们之间出现了不同寻常的问题
We have an unusual problem,Jane.

666
01:06:58,295 --> 01:07:03,133
很明显你希望我死，而我也越来越不为你考虑
You obviously want me dead.And I'm less and less concerned of your well-being.

667
01:07:03,258 --> 01:07:05,469
那我们怎么办？
So, what do we do?

668
01:07:06,678 --> 01:07:10,182
在这里决斗？看谁运气好？
Do we shoot it out here? Hope for the best?

669
01:07:10,307 --> 01:07:13,446
那多难堪
Mm. Well, that would be a shame...

670
01:07:13,532 --> 01:07:15,699
你死了以后他们一定会把我撵出去的
because they would probably ask me to leave once you're dead.

671
01:07:19,899 --> 01:07:22,193
陪我跳个舞
Dance with me.

672
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:27,657
- 你从不跳舞的 - 那只是掩护的一部分，宝贝
You don't dance.- Just part of my cover,sweetheart.

673
01:07:27,782 --> 01:07:30,160
懒惰也是吗？
Was sloth part of it too?

674
01:07:38,126 --> 01:07:40,044
你说这个故事的结局会是皆大欢喜吗？
You think this story's gonna have a happy ending?

675
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:44,883
皆大欢喜的只有那些没有结束的故事
Happy endings are just stories that haven't finished yet.

676
01:08:05,445 --> 01:08:07,488
满意了？
Satisfied?

677
01:08:07,613 --> 01:08:10,033
好多年没满足了
Not for years.

678
01:08:16,914 --> 01:08:19,208
那是小约翰 亲爱的
That's all John, sweetheart.

679
01:08:37,268 --> 01:08:38,752
为什么我们的婚姻会失败？
Why is it you think we failed?

680
01:08:38,852 --> 01:08:40,720
因为我们有各自不同的生活？
Because we were leading separate lives?

681
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:43,149
还是因为我们互相撒谎？
Or was it all the lying that did us in?

682
01:08:43,274 --> 01:08:46,360
我有一个新的理论
I have a theory. Newly formed.

683
01:08:46,485 --> 01:08:49,363
- 洗耳恭听 - 都是你的错
- I'm breathless to hear it.- You killed us.

684
01:08:49,488 --> 01:08:51,782
可笑
Provocative.

685
01:08:52,658 --> 01:08:54,168
你对待婚姻就像对待工作，
You approached our marriage like a job-

686
01:08:54,268 --> 01:08:56,600
先侦查，再计划，然后执行
something to be reconned,planned and executed.

687
01:08:57,538 --> 01:08:59,707
那你做了什么去积极避免婚姻的失败呢？
And you avoided it.

688
01:08:59,832 --> 01:09:02,376
这重要么？我只是你计划的一部分
What do you care,if I was just a cover?

689
01:09:02,501 --> 01:09:05,671
我真的希望你只是计划的一部分
Well, who said you were just a cover?

690
01:09:05,796 --> 01:09:08,591
- 难道我不是么？ - 我不是么？
- Wasn't I? - Well, wasn't I?

691
01:09:15,639 --> 01:09:17,975
我要去……失陪
I have to- Excuse me.

692
01:09:18,809 --> 01:09:21,103
出口不在那边，珍妮
No exits up there,Jane.

693
01:09:25,149 --> 01:09:28,026
保持冷静，约翰，她是个骗子
Be cold,John. She's a liar.

694
01:09:32,072 --> 01:09:34,408
要非常冷静
Be super cold.

695
01:09:47,879 --> 01:09:50,173
来，女士，这边
Come on, honey! This way!

696
01:10:06,273 --> 01:10:09,151
你身上有什么在嘀嗒嘀嗒的叫？
Do you know that you're ticking?

697
01:10:13,822 --> 01:10:16,241
后退，后退！
Get back!Get back! Get back!

698
01:10:21,413 --> 01:10:22,890
坐车么，先生？
Limo, sir?

699
01:10:39,431 --> 01:10:40,515
珍妮·史密斯
Jane Smith.

700
01:10:41,015 --> 01:10:41,875
这是你第二次企图杀我
That's the second time you tried to kill me.

701
01:10:41,975 --> 01:10:44,136
只是个小炸弹而已
Oh, come on.It was just a little bomb.

702
01:10:44,811 --> 01:10:47,856
我这就回家 把所有买给你的东西烧掉
I want you to know. I'm goin'home, and I'm gonna burn everything I ever bought you.

703
01:10:47,981 --> 01:10:50,650
比比看谁快
I'll race you there, baby.

704
01:11:06,332 --> 01:11:08,042
你已经到了么？
You there yet?

705
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:11,546
我们第一次见面时，你第一感觉是什么？
The first time we met,what was your first thought?

706
01:11:12,171 --> 01:11:14,090
你先说
You tell me.

707
01:11:14,215 --> 01:11:16,467
我……
I thought-

708
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:22,557
你给我的感觉就像圣诞节的早上
I thought you looked like Christmas morning.

709
01:11:23,599 --> 01:11:26,352
难以形容
I don't know how else to say it.

710
01:11:26,477 --> 01:11:29,063
为什么你现在和我说这个？
And why are you telling me this now?

711
01:11:30,022 --> 01:11:34,485
也许到了故事结尾时才会怀念故事开始的情节
I guess, in the end,you start thinkin' about the beginning.

712
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,574
我只是想让你知道我在想什么
So there it is.I thought you should know.

713
01:11:41,534 --> 01:11:44,370
那你呢，珍妮？
So how about it,Jane? Hmm?

为某个和WE频道竞争的频道工作
whatever channel it is that competes against the WE channel.

861
01:35:28,127 --> 01:35:30,118
知道我说什么吗 明白我的意思么 - 嗯
- Know what I'm saying? You following me? - Mm-hmm.

862
01:35:30,643 --> 01:35:34,480
道理很简单，一旦你们俩被除名
Johnny, the point is simple. Once you guys decide to get off the reservation, that's it.

863
01:35:34,606 --> 01:35:37,525
- 你们就永远被除名了(还要被灭口)- 埃迪，情况有多坏？
- Then you're off the reservation.- Eddie, how bad?

864
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:40,111
有多坏？
- How bad is it? - Mm.

865
01:35:40,236 --> 01:35:42,447
你记得加拿大那次吗？
You remember Canada.

866
01:35:42,905 --> 01:35:44,043
- 跟你们比是小儿科
That was kid stuff next to what you're up against.

867
01:35:44,143 --> 01:35:45,224
- 那是你杀的？管你什么事儿？
- That was you? - Oh, is that a turn-on?

868
01:35:45,324 --> 01:35:46,045
她是不是想用车撞死你？
- She tried to kill you with a car.

869
01:35:46,145 --> 01:35:48,436
这又不是我的主意 - 够了
Not my business. - Stop.

870
01:35:48,536 --> 01:35:51,539
我不多嘴了，可这是事实
A good friend stays out of it.I understand. This is the facts.

871
01:35:51,664 --> 01:35:53,952
这么说吧，如果你们二人分开，还有一线希望
If you two separate from each other, you got a shot.

872
01:35:54,052 --> 01:35:57,021
不是什么好主意 约翰 但是你还有机会
Not a great shot,Johnny,but you got a shot.

873
01:35:57,378 --> 01:36:01,132
如果你们还在一起，只有死路一条！
You two stay together,you're dead.

874
01:36:01,257 --> 01:36:05,887
除非你们可以找到什么比你们更让他们感兴趣的东西
Unless you can find something that they want more than they want you.

875
01:36:10,349 --> 01:36:14,478
找到他了，他被关在政府大楼的地下二层的D区
Found him. He's being held in subbasement ""D'' of the federal courthouse.

876
01:36:14,603 --> 01:36:19,775
戒备森严，有监视器和热感应器，电源直接来自市电站
High security.Motion and thermal.Power's on a city grid.

877
01:36:20,609 --> 01:36:23,654
我只能帮你这些了，珍妮
This is as far as we go,Jane.

878
01:36:23,779 --> 01:36:27,658
- 那好，谢谢- 祝你走运，宝贝
- Right. Thanks for everything.- Good luck, babe.

879
01:36:29,655 --> 01:36:32,055
有一股西北风
We have this northwesterly flow...

880
01:36:32,157 --> 01:36:34,091
穿越中部地区
coming down through the middle of the country.

881
01:36:34,193 --> 01:36:36,093
所以我们可以看到在这一片区域...
So we're seeing successive areas...

882
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:38,627
你们可以换一下台吗？
Do one of you guys mind changing the channel?

883
01:36:40,963 --> 01:36:46,385
尼克，你能不能抬抬你那个大屁股，给我换一下台
Nick.Would you please get off your fat ass and change the channel?

884
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:48,474
我知道这很难，谢谢了
I know. It's tough.Thank you.

885
01:36:48,574 --> 01:36:51,737
未来温度可能会持续下降
That's going to make things even colder than they are right now.

886
01:37:10,696 --> 01:37:12,687
你们走吧
You guys go.

887
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:21,073
我们有30秒时间，，我切断电源，你带人走
Thirty-second window.I cut the power,you grab the kid.

888
01:37:21,173 --> 01:37:24,040
很简单 明白了么 - 明白
Simple and clean. Got it? - Got it.

889
01:37:25,924 --> 01:37:28,468
告诉我，你一共杀过多少人？
So tell me. How many?

890
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,347
和这有关系吗？
Does it matter?

891
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:35,100
- 我先说好了 - 好啊
- Should I go first? - Okay.

892
01:37:35,642 --> 01:37:38,270
我记不太清了……不过
I don't exactly keep count, but

893
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:41,398
大概有……
I would say...

894
01:37:41,523 --> 01:37:43,817
50到60个 - 嗯
- high 50s, low 60s.- Mm-hmm.

895
01:37:45,902 --> 01:37:49,156
我从不松懈，不过最重要的还是……
Been around the block, but...you know, the important thing is

896
01:37:49,281 --> 01:37:51,408
312个
312

897
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:55,078
312个？
31 2?

898
01:37:56,955 --> 01:37:59,457
- 怎么可能？- 有时一次两个
- How?- Some were two at a time.

899
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:08,800
- 宝贝？- 别说了……
- Honey.- I'm- I'm- I'm-

900
01:38:19,765 --> 01:38:21,790
找到他了
Baby's in the crib.

901
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:26,925
你把看热闹的也算进去了？
Are you counting innocent bystanders?

902
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:36,702
- 你在监视着周围么？- 周围都查过了
- Monitoring the perimeter?- I checked the perimeter.

903
01:38:36,803 --> 01:38:39,681
- 警察的频率呢？- 正在监听
- What about the police bands?- I am on the police bands.

904
01:38:39,806 --> 01:38:41,933
- 保持连接 - 我又不是新手
- Connected to the main - This is not my first time.

905
01:38:43,268 --> 01:38:45,591
为了确保成功
I think we've established that.

906
01:38:49,357 --> 01:38:50,358
好吧
All right.

907
01:38:52,444 --> 01:38:54,696
向左转
Turn left.

908
01:38:54,821 --> 01:38:56,531
向左转，约翰
Left,John.

909
01:38:57,282 --> 01:38:58,825
向左转
Left!

910
01:38:59,409 --> 01:39:01,807
你不能和蔼一点么？别这么对我说话好吗
Be nice.You don't have to talk to me like that. Okay?

911
01:39:03,538 --> 01:39:06,458
- 请左转 - 我不能向左转
Left, please? - I can't go left. You see?

912
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:10,045
左边没路 看见了么
There is no left. Look.

913
01:39:10,170 --> 01:39:12,589
要么向前，要么回去
I have straight.I have back the way I came.

914
01:39:12,714 --> 01:39:14,883
左边没路，你要我向哪走？
There's no left.Which way do you want me to go?

915
01:39:15,008 --> 01:39:18,303
- 等我的信号- 看到这儿都是水么？
-Just stay there and wait for my mark.- See what I'm sitting in?

916
01:39:18,428 --> 01:39:20,388
看到么？
See that?

917
01:39:21,431 --> 01:39:23,725
- 慢慢来 - 行了，待着别动
- Take your time.- Yeah. All right. Stay.

918
01:39:23,850 --> 01:39:26,603
待着别动 等我的信号，马上就好了
Stay there.Wait for my mark. I'll find it.

919
01:39:28,438 --> 01:39:30,565
等我的信号
Wait for my mark.

920
01:39:34,944 --> 01:39:39,324
马上就好了，不知道是怎么回事，等一下
Almost there.I don't know what happened.Just hold on.

921
01:39:46,372 --> 01:39:50,793
约翰，你在干什么呢？
What are you-John, what are you doing?What are you doing?

922
01:39:50,918 --> 01:39:53,629
我给你信号，你就切断照明
Kill the lights on my signal.

923
01:39:54,630 --> 01:39:57,050
切！
Now. Kill the lights.

924
01:39:58,468 --> 01:40:00,845
- 珍妮，切断电源！ - 那是什么？
Jane, kill the lights.- Hey. Who's that?

925
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:04,336
- 哪儿？- 把灯开开！笨蛋！
- Where? - No, no. Not now! Turn 'em back on!

926
01:40:05,437 --> 01:40:06,768
笨蛋
- Idiot!

927
01:40:07,310 --> 01:40:09,437
- 他们来了- 给我打开手铐
- Here they come.- Hey, Nick. Uncuff me.

928
01:40:10,104 --> 01:40:13,941
把灯打开，把灯打开！
Turn 'em on!Turn 'em back on!

929
01:40:15,443 --> 01:40:17,612
- 把灯打开！- 好
- Turn it back on.- All right.

930
01:40:18,404 --> 01:40:21,324
- 开灯！ - 闭嘴！
Give me light. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

931
01:40:24,243 --> 01:40:26,412
- 尼克！- 闭嘴！
- Nick.- Shut up.

932
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:33,627
给我一把枪，尼克，给我一把枪！
Give me a gun.Nick, give me a gun.

933
01:40:58,985 --> 01:40:59,725
快开门！
Open the door.

934
01:41:01,549 --> 01:41:02,688
快开门
open the door

935
01:41:05,458 --> 01:41:07,426
后门
Back there.

936
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:12,225
小心点，快进来
Look out.Move, move, move.

937
01:41:17,537 --> 01:41:19,528
这是个老谋深算的家伙
This guy's a wily one.

938
01:41:26,646 --> 01:41:28,477
关门
Shut the door.

939
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:31,346
快，快，另一条路
Move. Move. The other way.

940
01:41:35,922 --> 01:41:38,015
这玩意是怎么弄的
How's this work?

941
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:42,434
我告诉你要等我的信号
I told you to wait for my signal.

942
01:41:42,534 --> 01:41:44,661
- 你没有等我的信号 - 是的，我随机应变了
- You didn't wait for my signal. - Well, I improvised.

943
01:41:45,155 --> 01:41:47,532
- 你把整个计划打乱了 - 你的计划有问题
- You deviated from the plan. - The plan was flawed.

944
01:41:47,658 --> 01:41:51,203
- 我的计划没有问题 - 死心眼儿
- The plan was not flawed. - Anal.

945
01:41:51,328 --> 01:41:54,164
- 这叫有组织，有纪律 - 珍妮，90%的时候要靠本能
- Organized. -Jane, 90% of this job is instinct.

946
01:41:54,289 --> 01:41:55,847
你的本能把报警器都搞响了
Your instincts set off every alarm in the building.

947
01:41:55,947 --> 01:41:58,472
但任务完成了，虽然不是珍妮式的
My instincts got the job done.May not have been theJane show.

948
01:41:58,627 --> 01:42:02,672
不是，这是约翰式的，就像那次圣诞节，我们的结婚周年纪念
No. It was theJohn show. It was half-assed.Like Christmas. Like our anniversary.

949
01:42:02,798 --> 01:42:05,090
还有那次你忘了给我妈买生日礼物
Like the time you forgot to bring my mother's birthday present.

950
01:42:05,790 --> 01:42:06,612
你假妈的生日！
Your fake mother's birthday.

951
01:42:07,115 --> 01:42:10,472
问题是 你总是第一个脱离团队的
The point is, you are always the first to break team.

952
01:42:10,597 --> 01:42:13,475
你不需要团队，只是想要几个给你打杂的仆人
You don't want a team. You-You want a servant for hire.

953
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,394
我想要个靠得住的人
I want someone I can count on.

954
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:18,870
珍妮，你太咄咄逼人了
Jane, there's no air around you anymore.

955
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:20,870
你说这话什么意思？
Okay. What is that supposed to mean?

956
01:42:21,358 --> 01:42:25,987
我是说你容不得一丝错误，不容自由发挥
It means there's no room for mistakes. No mistakes whatsoever.

957
01:42:26,112 --> 01:42:26,611
我的意思 这谁能受得了？
No spontaneity. I mean, who can answer to that?

958
01:42:26,711 --> 01:42:28,640
你完全可以不这么做
Well, you don't have to. Do you?

959
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:31,534
因为这根本不是真正的婚姻
'Cause this isn't even a real marriage.

960
01:42:32,577 --> 01:42:35,538
- 你们到底是谁？- 闭嘴！
-  Who are you people?- Shut up!

961
01:42:38,623 --> 01:42:40,791
你现在见证了
So, now I realize...

962
01:42:40,917 --> 01:42:43,995
我和我老婆有些家庭纠纷
you witnessed the missus and I working through some domestic issues.

963
01:42:44,095 --> 01:42:45,029
哦
Oh

964
01:42:45,129 --> 01:42:47,423
甚为遗憾
That's regrettable.

965
01:42:48,716 --> 01:42:52,303
但是别以为我们会手软，这样想就错了
But don't take that as a sign of weakness.That would be a mistake on your part.

966
01:42:52,428 --> 01:42:54,972
告诉我们，你知道什么
Now tell us what you know.

967
01:42:55,097 --> 01:42:58,017
为什么我们两个的老板都希望你死
Why do both our bosses want you dead?

968
01:42:59,810 --> 01:43:02,730
你....
You unders-

969
01:43:02,855 --> 01:43:04,649
宝贝，拜托
Honey, please.

970
01:43:04,749 --> 01:43:06,649
好吧
Wrap it up.

971
01:43:07,359 --> 01:43:11,197
在人质面前也要给我留点面子吧
Maybe it's not such a good idea to undermine me in front of the hostage.

972
01:43:11,322 --> 01:43:13,574
会给人错误的印象
Sends a mixed message.

973
01:43:14,366 --> 01:43:16,035
对不起
Sorry.

974
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:18,204
女人就是这样
Girls.

975
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:22,291
好了，问到哪儿了？
Okay.  Where was I?

976
01:43:22,416 --> 01:43:24,877
- 是你的错 - 闭嘴，听着
-""A mistake on your part." - Shut up. Options.

977
01:43:25,002 --> 01:43:26,071
下面我要给你几条路走，A……
I'm gonna lay out your options for you.Okay? Option "A. '"

978
01:43:26,171 --> 01:43:27,988
我能不能...
If I could

979
01:43:28,088 --> 01:43:30,424
闭嘴
Shut up.

980
01:43:30,549 --> 01:43:34,303
A，我们问，你回答，没有痛苦
Option "A. '" You talk. We listen.No pain.

981
01:43:34,428 --> 01:43:36,847
B，如果你不说
Option ""B.''You don't talk.

982
01:43:36,972 --> 01:43:40,559
我会用钳子把你大拇指拔掉，会很疼的
I remove your thumbs with my pliers.It will hurt.

983
01:43:41,435 --> 01:43:43,562
选项C
Option ""C.''

984
01:43:43,687 --> 01:43:47,816
我会换一些花样，不过最终的结局都是你死
I like to vary the details a bit,but the punch line is you die.

985
01:43:49,894 --> 01:43:50,844
- 本杰明 - 好的
- Benjamin. - Okay.

986
01:43:50,944 --> 01:43:54,865
我们不是很有耐心的人
We're impatient people.

987
01:44:01,038 --> 01:44:04,583
能给我来杯汽水吗？果汁也行
Can I get a soda? Or a juice or, uh, some-

988
01:44:05,459 --> 01:44:08,128
A！A！我选A！
""A.'' ""A.'' Option ""A.'' Aaah!

989
01:44:08,253 --> 01:44:11,631
- 好痛啊- 打得好
- Oh, that hurt.- Okay. That was a nice shot.

990
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:18,930
你吓得哆嗦了么？
What's-You got a spasm?

991
01:44:19,055 --> 01:44:22,767
我动不了，你们自己看我裤兜里的东西
I'm tied up.Why don't you check my back pocket?

992
01:44:31,401 --> 01:44:34,487
我不是目标，你们才是 你们俩
I'm not the target. You are.Both of you

993
01:44:35,530 --> 01:44:35,974
他们知道你们结婚了
They found out you're married...

994
01:44:36,074 --> 01:44:39,339
所以让你们去杀同一个目标
so they teamed up and sent youto the same hit to target each other.

995
01:44:40,535 --> 01:44:42,662
这是你们两个公司合作的计划
It was a joint task force by both your companies.

996
01:44:42,787 --> 01:44:46,875
两个互相竞争的杀手住在同一屋檐下，这不是什么好事
Two competing agents living under the same roof.It's bad for business.

997
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,588
- 他们想你们自相残杀 - 你是个诱饵
- They wanted you to take each other out.- You were bait.

998
01:44:51,713 --> 01:44:54,674
我才来公司，初级员工
Well, it's entry level.Toehold into the company.

999
01:44:54,799 --> 01:44:58,470
给我这么重要的任务，其实很不错
Couple hits,they bump me up to a desk.It's pretty cool actually.

1000
01:44:58,595 --> 01:45:00,265
你把照片放在口袋里干什么？
You keep the photo in your back pocket?

1001
01:45:00,365 --> 01:45:01,831
难道还要我去配个镜框？
What was I supposed to do? Frame it?

1002
01:45:01,931 --> 01:45:03,401
应该毁掉，烧掉
You get rid of it. You burn it.

1003
01:45:03,501 --> 01:45:05,001
这是第101条守则 可能我没看到这一条
- Tradecraft 1 01 .- I'm sorry. I guess I skipped that day.

1004
01:45:05,101 --> 01:45:10,273
不过你们可能也没看到不能和敌人结婚这一条
Just like I guess you skipped the day about not marrying the enemy.

1005
01:45:10,398 --> 01:45:12,650
你现在仍然是诱饵么？
You were bait,or you are bait?

1006
01:45:16,904 --> 01:45:19,240
腰带！腰带，老兄
Belt. Belt. Belt, dude.

1007
01:45:27,623 --> 01:45:30,084
2分钟
Two minutes.

1008
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:33,004
1分钟
One minute.

1009
01:45:57,778 --> 01:45:58,823
帮帮我啊
A little help.

1010
01:45:58,923 --> 01:45:59,430
安全
Clear.

1011
01:45:59,530 --> 01:46:01,782
安全
Clear.

1012
01:46:02,789 --> 01:46:05,781
嘿，我想我撞坏我的牙了，我们这有牙医吗？
Hey, I think I chipped my tooth.Do you know if we have dental?

1013
01:46:21,218 --> 01:46:24,346
我外逃的船停在拉巴斯
My way out is a boat standing by in La Paz.

1014
01:46:27,308 --> 01:46:30,394
我的在阿特拉斯山脉，说这个干嘛？
Cargo drop, Atlas Mountains. So what?

1015
01:46:30,519 --> 01:46:33,105
这样我们即使分开也能找到对方
So, at least, apart, we know what the odds are.

1016
01:46:35,649 --> 01:46:38,110
这一次
Let's just call this what it is...

1017
01:46:39,194 --> 01:46:41,739
我们只能听天由命了
and what it isn't.

1018
01:46:45,701 --> 01:46:47,911
为什么我们的婚姻这么糟糕？
All right. So it's a crap marriage.

1019
01:46:48,036 --> 01:46:51,707
我们天生就是冤家对头
All right. I'm a mess.You're a disaster.

1020
01:46:51,832 --> 01:46:54,084
我们俩都是骗子
We're both liars.

1021
01:46:55,586 --> 01:46:58,589
但是如果你逃走，你一生都只能逃亡
But you run,you'll always be running.

1022
01:47:00,674 --> 01:47:03,302
我说咱们留下来，战斗到底
I say we stay and we fight.

1023
01:47:03,427 --> 01:47:06,388
把这一切解决
We finish this thing.

1024
01:47:06,513 --> 01:47:08,682
到时，如果你想走，我不拦你
Then if you wanna go,you can go.

1025
01:47:08,807 --> 01:47:10,976
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

1026
01:47:11,101 --> 01:47:16,023
说什么“听天由命”，真是的
What? ""Let's call this what it is.''Jesus Christ.

1027
01:47:16,148 --> 01:47:18,442
- 住手……- 别动
- Stop.- Don't.

1028
01:47:32,150 --> 01:47:33,845
哦，天呐
Oh,Jesus.

1029
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:49,671
这家店真不错
This is a really good store.

1030
01:48:33,501 --> 01:48:37,421
- 珍妮，下辈子再见- 你也一样
- See you in the next life,Jane.- Likewise,John.

1031
01:50:16,748 --> 01:50:18,648
哦

1032
01:50:19,773 --> 01:50:21,942
对不起
Sorry.

1033
01:50:24,861 --> 01:50:28,114
回去和你算帐
We'll talk about this later.

1034
01:50:41,878 --> 01:50:44,214
上帝啊！
Jesus!

1035
01:50:46,299 --> 01:50:49,886
- 不是我碰的 - 就是你
- I didn't touch a thing.- Yes, you did.

1036
01:51:29,175 --> 01:51:33,429
- 对不起，那把刀…… - 我不想谈
- Sorry about the, uh, knife in- - I don't want to talk about it.

1037
01:51:38,184 --> 01:51:40,519
- 我负责狙击 - 我来当诱饵
- I'll fly. - I'll be bait.

1038
01:51:41,687 --> 01:51:44,607
我顺时针移动，帮我看着背后 - 好的
- I'm goin' clockwise, so watch my 6:00. - All right.

1039
01:52:44,822 --> 01:52:46,782
走！
Go! Move!

1040
01:54:30,473 --> 01:54:32,767
情况怎么样？
How's it look?

1041
01:54:35,812 --> 01:54:38,106
小菜一碟
It's a piece of cake.

1042
01:54:46,781 --> 01:54:49,158
小心点
Watch these.

1043
01:54:49,283 --> 01:54:51,577
他们都疯了 小心点
They tend to jam. So watch 'em.

1044
01:54:52,495 --> 01:54:56,874
你喜欢左边了，那我就打右边
You favor your left, sweetheart,so look out for right.

1045
01:55:09,261 --> 01:55:12,642
现在想想，拉巴斯的那条船肯定很不错
Damn. That boat in La Paz is lookin'pretty good right now, isn't it?

1046
01:55:16,936 --> 01:55:20,189
这个时候那边应该是雨季
Well, it rains a lot this time of year.

1047
01:55:25,295 --> 01:55:27,255
闭嘴
Shut up.

1048
01:56:56,302 --> 01:57:00,264
我对你们这几个星期的进步很感兴趣
I'm interested in the progress you've made in the last few weeks.

1049
01:57:00,389 --> 01:57:02,720
我们还可以吧, 但说实话，我的意思是..你知道...
Uh, doin' all right, aren't we? I mean, listen.I'm not gonna lie to you.

1050
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:04,947
有时候，我真的想……
There were times I just wanted to-

1051
01:57:05,561 --> 01:57:08,063
- 杀了她, 但是……- 我也一样

1052
01:57:08,188 --> 01:57:10,691
- 下不了手 - 那是好事儿啊
couldn't take the shot.- That's a good sign.

1053
01:57:10,816 --> 01:57:13,485
- 谁能想到呢？ - 有时候你们必须努力去克服困难
- Who would've thought.- Sometimes you have to battle through.

1054
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:18,365
- 那就是婚姻，不是吗？- 对，只要我们努力……
- That's marriage, right?- Yeah. You take your best shot and-

1055
01:57:18,490 --> 01:57:19,904

- Oh. We redid the house.

1056
01:57:20,004 --> 01:57:21,972
- 是啊，没错

生活中总会有这样那样的困难和威胁

对

你们只要齐心协力就可以克服
But you can handle it together.

01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:33,964
- 至少现在 - 是的，我们可以……至少现在？
- So far.- Yes, we ca- So far?

1061
01:57:35,048 --> 01:57:37,384
这是什么意思？

1062
01:57:37,509 --> 01:57:40,679
- 将来是什么样很难说啊 - 至少现在……
I'm leaving room for the unknown. So far.

而且你们是不是感觉到现在的关系会更有利于……
And do you feel that your relationship styles... are more conducive to the free flow-

But hanging out would have to wait.

Actually, when I was young and crazy,

One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.

00:36:32,629 --> 00:36:37,126
And years longer to apply it in combat!
还要更多年才能用于实战

445
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:47,878
Put that down!
把那放下！

446
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:52,480
The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones.
我们这儿收集的纪念品只有伤筋断骨

447
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,729
Yeah! Excellent.
哦也！太帅了！

448
00:36:55,729 --> 00:36:57,358
Let's get started.
咱们开始吧

449
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,164
- Are you ready? - I was born re...

450
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:06,594
I'm sorry, brother. I thought you said you were ready.
抱歉，老兄，我还以为你说准备好了

451
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:09,595
That was awesome! Let's go again!
这可太过瘾了！咱们再来一次！

452
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,305
I've been taking it easy on you, panda. But no more.
我对你手下留情的，熊猫，可现在不会了

453
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:41,509
Your next opponent will be me.
你现在的对手轮到我了

454
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,509
All right! Yeah, let's go!
好啊！咱们来吧

455
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:47,494
Step forth.
往前一步

456
00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:51,621
The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness...
想要真正获胜，就要攻击你对手的弱点

457
00:37:51,621 --> 00:37:53,802
...and make him suffer for it.
让他因此痛不欲生

458
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:54,793
Oh, yeah!
噢，爽！

459
00:37:54,793 --> 00:37:57,838
To take his strength and use it against him...
要借力打力

460
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:00,252
...until he finally falls...
直到他被击倒⋯

461
00:38:00,252 --> 00:38:01,980
...or quits.
或放弃

462
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,132
A real warrior never quits.
一个真正的勇士绝不放弃

463
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:06,928
Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!
放心吧，师傅，我绝不放弃

464
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,326
If he's smart, he won't come back up those steps.
他要是聪明，就不会爬上来了

465
00:38:20,326 --> 00:38:22,226
But he will.
他会上来的

466
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:24,311
He's not going to quit, is he?
他不会放弃的，是吗？

467
00:38:24,311 --> 00:38:27,498
He's not going to quit bouncing, I'll tell you that.
我告诉你，他不会放弃翻滚的

468
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:42,770
I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better.
不是说针灸能让我好受些吗

469
00:38:42,451 --> 00:38:43,678
Trust me, it will.
听我的没错

470
00:38:43,678 --> 00:38:47,135
It's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this...
就是不太容易找准穴位，有这么多⋯

471
00:38:47,135 --> 00:38:50,132
- Fat? - Fur. I was going to say fur.
- 肥肉？ - 毛皮，我想要说的是毛皮

472
00:38:50,132 --> 00:38:51,126
Sure you were.
才怪

473
00:38:51,126 --> 00:38:55,167
Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? Look at me.
咱们不能以大小论英雄，你看我

474
00:38:56,366 --> 00:38:57,197
I'm over here.
我在这儿呢

475
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:00,751
Maybe you should look at this again.
你还是再看看这个吧

476
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:03,130
Oh, OK.
噢，对啊

477
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:08,009
Stop it. Stop!
停手，停下

478
00:39:09,121 --> 00:39:12,041
I know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all...
我明白师傅这是在点拨我

479
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:16,044
...but if I didn't know better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.
可要是不了解他，我会以为他想赶我走

480
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:23,384
I know he can seem kind of heartless...
我知道他看起来铁石心肠

481
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:26,166
...but he wasn't always like that.
可他以前不是这样

482
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:27,832
According to legend,
据传说

483
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:32,304
there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile.
曾经的师傅总是面带微笑

484
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:33,931
- No! - Yes.
- 瞎说！ - 真的

485
00:39:33,931 --> 00:39:35,556
But that was before.
不过是在那事儿以前

486
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:36,921
Before what?
什么以前？

487
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:38,852
Before Tai Lung.
是大龙的事儿

488
00:39:38,852 --> 00:39:41,749
We're not really supposed to talk about him.
我们其实不该去谈论他

489
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:44,993
Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know.
如果熊猫要留在这儿，他应该知道

490
00:39:44,993 --> 00:39:47,133
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.
伙计们，我知道大龙

491
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:52,410
He was a student. The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.
他是个弟子，第一个掌握了千卷功夫秘籍

492
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:56,331
And then he turned bad, and now he's in jail.
后来他心眼坏了，现在关在大牢里

493
00:39:56,331 --> 00:39:58,628
He wasn'tjust a student.

494
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:05,743
Shifu found him as a cub...
他刚生下来，就被师傅捡到了

495
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:09,888
...and he raised him as his son.

496
00:40:12,581 --> 00:40:15,843
And when the boy showed talent in kung fu...

497
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:18,341
...Shifu trained him.

00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:23,514
He believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness.

500
00:40:29,401 --> 00:40:31,419
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.
他想要神龙秘籍

But Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused.

Outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley.

He tried to take the scroll by force.

504
00:40:44,537 --> 00:40:48,804
And Shifu had to destroy what he had created.

505
00:40:50,713 --> 00:40:51,794
But how could he?
可又怎么忍心

506
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:10,376
Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before.
师傅从没像爱大龙那样爱过任何人

507
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:20,082
Or since.
以后也一样

508
00:41:28,593 --> 00:41:31,722
And now he has a chance to make things right.

510
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:36,484
And he's stuck with you.
碰着你这个活宝

511
00:41:36,484 --> 00:41:40,770
A big fat panda who treats it like a joke.

512
00:41:42,048 --> 00:41:42,957
That is it!

00:41:42,957 --> 00:41:46,002
Wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

静下心来

519
00:42:10,457 --> 00:42:14,725
Would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down?!
在那儿扇巴掌的人给我安静！

520
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:20,566
Inner...
静下⋯

521
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:24,196
Oh, Zeng.

There is just news. There is no good or bad.

Master, your vision. Your vision was right.

Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way.

00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:05,628
...if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.
要是你不相信神龙大侠能够阻止的话

532
00:43:05,628 --> 00:43:10,224
The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

He wasn't meant to be here! It was an accident.

the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours,

Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

I cannot make it blossom when it suits me,

nor make it bear fruit before its time.

仅凭银杏叶上的露珠和天地之气

Are you kidding? If they can't?!
